# movate — Feature Backlog

A ranked, checkable list of features for movate. Each item is sized to "thing a user could notice or test." This is the working backlog — the high-level phasing lives in the [implementation roadmap](../../.claude/plans/want-to-take-inspiration-stateful-swan.md).

## How to read this

```
- [ ] **Feature name** `[LEVERAGE] [PHASE] [STATUS] [EFFORT]` — one-line description.
```

| Tag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `[HIGH]` | Big unlock per unit effort. Ship these first. |
| `[MED]` | Worth doing but not urgent. |
| `[LOW]` | Nice-to-have or stop-energy. Defer or drop. |
| `[v0.1]…[v1.1+]` | Target release phase. |
| `[done]` | Already in repo. |
| `[next]` | Top-of-stack — pick this up next. |
| `[blocked:X]` | Waiting on X. |
| `[idea]` | Captured but no commitment. |
| `≤2h / ≤1d / 2-3d / 1w / 2w+` | Effort estimate. |

**Leverage** = (value to a movate user) ÷ (engineering effort + ongoing maintenance burden). When in doubt, prefer items with strong leverage even if their phase is later — you'll re-evaluate when those phases land.

**2026-05-13 PM addendum:** 16 PRs merged this afternoon shipped the entire **Mova iO Angular v1 endpoint surface** — Groups G + H end-to-end. v0.7 is live on `movate-dev-api.victoriouswater-7958662f.eastus2.azurecontainerapps.io`; Deva has a bearer + 12 wrapper scripts in `scripts/deva-curl/`. Live smoke surfaced one architecture gap (wizard agents land on API pod's filesystem; worker pod can't see them — item 109) + 10 usability items now tracked as **Group I**. The previous "Top 10" below is stale — see Group I and Group H for the active Thursday/Friday queue.

**2026-05-13 EOD addendum (post-PR-#110):** 3 more PRs shipped the Friday-critical hybrid: inline run mode (`?wait=true`), CI lockfile drift check, and the package-version bump to 0.7.0. v0.7.0 redeployed to `movate-dev-rg`; smoke verified live — wizard creates `smoke-bot`, then `POST /agents/smoke-bot/runs?wait=true&mock=true` returns 200 + full RunView in 244 ms. **All four of Deva's verbs are wired + verified against Azure: create, run (async OR inline), eval, observability.** Day total: **19 PRs merged, 1437 tests passing (+124 over the session), 1 architecture gap discovered + worked around, 1 production runtime live with all v1 endpoints serving.**

### Session 2026-05-13 — Teams demo loop + ADR 002 closeout

**Teams Slice 3.1.e — Teams manifest + Azure Bot Service registration shipped this session.** 15 new tests (1296 → 1311 total). The remaining piece of the Teams demo loop — package the bot as an actual Teams app and wire Azure Bot Service so Teams can route Activities to the deployed bot. New `appPackage/manifest.json` (Teams v1.16) with three scopes (personal/team/groupchat), commandLists for the autocomplete UI, `supportsFiles: true` for 3.1.d uploads; placeholder 192x192 + 32x32 PNG icons (generated via stdlib zlib so CI doesn't need binary blobs). New `scripts/teams-package.sh` zipper that substitutes `MOVATE_TEAMS_BOT_APP_ID` / version / validDomains from env at build time, warns loudly on the placeholder UUID (Teams Admin Center would reject it). Two new Bicep modules: `infra/azure/modules/containerapp-teams-bot.bicep` (Container App running `mdk teams-bot serve`; ingress port 3978; reads three KV secrets — fleet API key, encryption key, Bot Service AAD password) and `bot-service.bicep` (Bot Service registration + Teams channel; F0 for non-prod, S1 for prod; bound to an AAD app the operator pre-creates via `az ad app create`). Main.bicep wires both behind a single `enableTeamsBot` flag mirroring `enableApiWorker`'s two-pass pattern. New `docs/teams-deploy.md` 6-step runbook from "you have an Azure sub" to "Teams users `@movate ping` works". Bicep build + lint clean. **PR #87 (this one). Closes [#69](https://github.com/mova-io/mova-cli/issues/69) (modulo the manual `az ad app create` + Teams Admin Center upload step which lives in the runbook). Demo loop complete.**

**Teams Slice 3.1.d — file attachment handling shipped this session.** 33 new tests (1263 → 1296 total). Drag an `agent.yaml`, a zipped agent directory, or a `dataset.jsonl` into Teams and the bot validates + reports back as an Adaptive Card. New `src/movate/teams_bot/attachments.py`: async pipeline (`fetch_bytes` for file:// + http(s)://, 4MB cap; `classify` by filename suffix; `ingest_attachment` orchestrates download → materialise → validate; `temp_workspace` context-manager for per-request scratch; zip-slip protection rejects archives with `..` paths before extraction). New `src/movate/teams_bot/cards/upload.py`: `build_agent_upload_card` (FactSet showing runtime/model/skills/objectives/contexts; description container) and `build_dataset_upload_card` (row count + first-row preview, pluralisation-aware). Handler detects `activity.attachments` before slash-command parse and routes through `_handle_upload`. Run-against-uploaded-agent deferred — needs a runtime API change so `/run` accepts an inline bundle (not just a registered name); tracked as a follow-up. Microsoft Graph auth for production Teams attachments also deferred (Bot Framework Emulator's file:// URLs work today). **PR #86. Closes [#68](https://github.com/mova-io/mova-cli/issues/68).**

**Teams Slice 3.1.c — per-user identity binding shipped this session.** 33 new tests (1230 → 1263 total). Each Teams user binds their own Movate API key via DM (`/movate connect <api-key>`) so every `@movate run` they trigger uses THEIR key, with `RunRecord.created_by` audit attribution correct in multi-user deployments. Keys encrypted at rest via Fernet (`cryptography` package, AES-128-CBC + HMAC-SHA256); operator supplies the key via `MOVATE_TEAMS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` env, bot fails fast at boot if missing. New modules: `src/movate/teams_bot/crypto.py` (Fernet wrapper, typed errors), `storage.py` (aiosqlite `teams_users` table — sqlite-only for alpha, Postgres tracked as follow-up), `identity.py` (LRU-cached per-user MovateClient resolver). New DM-only commands: `connect`, `whoami`, `disconnect` — channel posts rejected with a "DM me" card so keys never leak. `run` routes through resolver first (bound user) → fleet client (unbound, default) → reject card (unbound + `--require-binding`). Three modes: default (alpha), strict (`--require-binding`), no-identity (smoke-test). KMS swap is interface-compatible. **PR #83. Closes [#67](https://github.com/mova-io/mova-cli/issues/67).**

**Teams Slice 3.1.b — Adaptive Cards + MovateClient integration shipped this session.** 30 new tests. Replaced the 3.1.a echo with real agent execution + a rendered scorecard. New `src/movate/teams_bot/cards/` package (pure functions `RunResponse → dict`): `run_result.py` (response body, cost, latency, optional Langfuse trace link), `error.py` (failure card with category + one-line hint, no stack traces — those live in Langfuse). New `src/movate/teams_bot/client.py` with `execute_run()` wrapping `MovateClient.submit_job` → `wait_for_terminal` → `get_run`, returning a discriminated `RunOutcome`. Per-call timeout configurable via `MOVATE_TEAMS_RUN_TIMEOUT_S` (default 25s, under Teams' channel timeout). Handler dispatches on the variant — success / terminal_failure / timeout / client_failure / parse_error → distinct cards. Hint lookup table for operator-friendly suggestions on common error codes. New `Attachment` model on `ReplyActivity` for delivering Adaptive Cards inline. `build_app()` now accepts `runtime_url` / `fleet_api_key` / `langfuse_public_host` / `runtime_client` args; holds a long-lived MovateClient so the connection pool stays warm across requests. **PR #82. Closes [#66](https://github.com/mova-io/mova-cli/issues/66).**

**Teams Slice 3.1.a — Bot Framework webhook skeleton shipped this session.** 28 new tests. First half-day slice of [ADR 003](docs/adr/003-teams-integration.md) — `mdk teams-bot serve` opens a FastAPI app on port 3978 (Bot Framework Emulator default), parses `@movate <command>` mentions, replies with plain text for `ping` / `help` / `run` (3.1.a echoes parsed args; 3.1.b wires real execution). Hand-rolled the Activity protocol (Pydantic models for Activity, ChannelAccount, ConversationAccount, Mention, ReplyActivity) instead of pulling in `botbuilder-core` (~30MB of azure-core transitive deps + JWT validation we don't need in the local-dev skeleton). New `[teams]` extra: `fastapi` + `uvicorn`. New `mdk teams-bot serve` Typer subcommand under Deploy & operate panel. Hardening PR for JWT validation lands separately before public exposure. **PR #63. Closes the skeleton portion of [#66](https://github.com/mova-io/mova-cli/issues/66) and lays the foundation for slices 3.1.b through 3.1.e.**

**ADR 003 — Microsoft Teams as a self-serve front door drafted this session.** 360-line design doc capturing the CEO ask: sales team should do the first demo themselves. Cardinal rule: Teams is a *client* of the existing v0.5 HTTP runtime — no new execution surface, no forked storage. Three slices: 3.1 run-existing → 3.2 eval-with-upload → 3.3 saved-configs + scheduled. Auth model: bot-fleet API key for admin ops + per-user Movate API keys bound via DM (3.1.c, shipped). Four falsification tests documented. Status: **Proposed** (open questions on multi-tenant prospects, Langfuse trace linking, mobile UX, streaming responses called out for follow-up). **PR #60.** Establishes the v0.7 milestone.

**Skills PR 6 — native tool-use across every runtime shipped this session.** 30 new tests across two PRs (#61 Anthropic, #62 OpenAI). **Closes [ADR 002](docs/adr/002-skills-and-contexts.md) completely** — every skill backend (Python / HTTP / MCP) now runs under every runtime (LiteLLM / native_anthropic / native_openai). Native Anthropic (PR #61): `to_tool_spec` override emitting Anthropic's flat `{name, description, input_schema}` shape; `complete()` parses `tool_use` content blocks → `CompletionResponse(kind="tool_use", ...)`; new `_translate_messages` helper folds the executor's OpenAI-style history (`role="assistant"` with `tool_calls` + `role="tool"` results) into Anthropic content blocks (`tool_use` on assistant messages, `tool_result` on user messages, consecutive tool_results coalesced into one user message). Native OpenAI (PR #62): smaller diff because the OpenAI SDK accepts the same flat-message + nested-tool-spec format the LiteLLM path uses — just `tools=` passthrough + response-shape parsing. First-wins on parallel tool calls (matches LiteLLM PR 1 decision; parallel-dispatch is tracked as [#74](https://github.com/mova-io/mova-cli/issues/74)). End-to-end integration tests with scripted FakeClients + real Python skills assert wire-payload correlation. **PRs #61 and #62.**

**Four-dimension eval reporting shipped this session.** 34 new tests + 2 reporter tests (1166 → 1200 total). **Flips the Tier 7 line item to done.** Every successful eval run now scores up to four dims per case: `accuracy` (existing v0.5 logic, exact-match OR LLM judge), `faithfulness` (LLM judge against optional `grounding` context — new dataset field), `coverage` (deterministic substring match against optional `expected_coverage` — new dataset field), `latency` (1.0 within budget, linear decay to 0.0 at 2x budget — uses agent's `timeouts.call_ms` or per-case `latency_budget_ms` override). New types: `Dimension` StrEnum, `DimensionScore`, `DimensionScores`, `DimensionalMeans`. Engine refactor with `_score_dimensions` orchestrator + per-dim methods. Critical back-compat: `CaseRun.score` (gate input) stays **accuracy-only** — `--gate 0.7` still means "70% accuracy across cases"; the other three dims are reporting-only. Rich table + JSON + markdown reporters all render the dimensional breakdown — but only when the dataset opts in to `faithfulness` or `coverage` (legacy datasets see the v0.5 view byte-for-byte). **PR #59.**

**Skill side_effects policy gate shipped this session.** 16 new tests. New `SkillPolicy` model in `core/config.py` with `allowed_side_effects: list[SkillSideEffects] | None`. Enforced at both `mdk validate` time (operators see policy violations before any execute attempt) AND executor entry (belt-and-braces — `mdk serve` can't bypass). Wired into `cli/_runtime.py` via `project_cfg.skills`. Closes the operator-confidence gap left after the canonical config split — operators can now declare "this project only runs `read-only` skills" and have it enforced uniformly. **PR #58.** Hardens the prospect-upload story for the eventual Teams slice 3.1.d.

**ADR 002 — Skills and shared contexts fully closed.** Today's PRs (#58 / #61 / #62) plus yesterday's #51-#57 close every slice in ADR 002. Skills work end-to-end across Python / HTTP / MCP backends and across LiteLLM / native_anthropic / native_openai runtimes; side_effects policy gates the inputs; shared contexts prepend automatically to prompts. Closing the ADR moves the Tier 1 / Tier 2 Deva-flagged demand to "done for the foreseeable future."

### Earlier sessions (most-recent first below)

**`mdk watch` hot-reload shipped this session.** 8 new tests (635 unit + 3 smoke = 638 total). New `cli/watch.py` polls the agent's files (agent.yaml, prompt, both schemas, dataset, judge.yaml) every 0.5s via stdlib mtime checks (no `watchdog`/`watchfiles` dep needed). On change, re-runs `_validate_agent` (which prints lint + cost forecast + validate output). 200ms debounce for editor write-then-rename. Catches broken-mid-save `AgentLoadError` and keeps polling. `--poll-interval` + `--strict` flags. **TDD-style feedback loop: save the prompt, see results in <1s.**

**Cost forecast shipped this session.** 10 new tests (627 unit + 3 smoke = 630 total). New `core/cost_forecast.py` with `estimate_eval_cost(bundle, *, pricing) -> CostForecast | None`. Renders each case's prompt with Jinja, estimates tokens via chars/4 (well-established for GPT/Anthropic), multiplies by the agent's model's pricing. Prints `eval cost: ~$0.045 (30 cases x ~120 in + ~1024 out tokens)` on every `mdk validate` when both a dataset + pricing entry exist; silent skip otherwise. Cases whose inputs miss schema fields get skipped (the prompt linter is the right tool for THAT diagnostic). **Catches "$4 surprise" bills BEFORE running the eval.**

**Prompt linter shipped this session.** 19 new tests (617 unit + 3 smoke = 620 total). New `core/prompt_linter.py` with four rules: `UNDECLARED_INPUT_REF` (error — Jinja2 AST analysis catches `{{ input.X }}` refs not in the input schema), `EMPTY_PROMPT` (error), `MISSING_JSON_INSTRUCTION` (warning), `NO_OUTPUT_SCHEMA_REFERENCE` (warning — prompt should mention at least one output field name), `TINY_PROMPT` (warning). Wired into `mdk validate`: errors exit 2 always; warnings print but don't fail by default; `--strict` promotes warnings to errors (CI gate); `--no-lint` escape hatch. Each issue carries a stable `code` for CI annotation filtering + a `hint` pointing at the fix. Critical correctness check: default scaffold passes every rule (else every `mdk init` would surface confusing warnings).

**Per-tenant monthly cost ceiling shipped this session.** 24 new tests (598 unit + 3 smoke = 601 total). New `TenantBudget` Pydantic model + `tenant_budgets` table on all 3 backends. Four new storage methods (`get_tenant_budget`, `upsert_tenant_budget`, `list_tenant_budgets`, `sum_tenant_cost_current_month`) with the perf-critical `(tenant_id, created_at)` index for the aggregation. `Executor._check_tenant_budget` runs FIRST at execute() entry — zero provider cost incurred on a budget-blocked run. New `TenantBudgetExceededError` + `FailureType.TENANT_BUDGET_EXCEEDED` (no retry, no fallback — the cap is the cap). New `mdk tenants set-budget | clear-budget | show | list` CLI with color-coded status (green / yellow ≥80% / red paused). Self-fixing error messages include the exact CLI command to raise the cap. Absent row = unlimited (v0.x-compat default). **Closes the runaway-cost gap that v1.0 stages 1-4 left open.**

**KEDA queue-depth worker autoscaling shipped this session.** Bicep-only change in `containerapp-worker.bicep` — replaced the CPU-utilization scale rule with a KEDA `postgresql` scaler that counts claimable jobs (`status='queued' AND retry-window-elapsed`). Queue depth is a leading indicator (load visible before any pod's CPU rises); CPU was lagging. `queueDepthPerReplica` param (default 5; prod 10, dev 3 via main.bicep) controls scale-up aggression. New KV secret `pg-connection-string` for KEDA's sidecar (distinct from the worker's `pg-password`). Operator runbook (`infra/azure/README.md` + `docs/azure-bootstrap.md`) updated. `az bicep build` + `az bicep lint` clean locally.

**Per-API-key rate limiting shipped this session.** 16 new tests (574 unit + 3 smoke = 577 total). Token-bucket algorithm (tolerates bursts) keyed on `api_key_id`. `core/rate_limit.py` with `RateLimiter` Protocol + `InProcessRateLimiter` + `NoOpRateLimiter`. Middleware integration: rate-limit AFTER successful auth (anonymous floods get 401 cheaply); `/healthz` + `/ready` bypass the limiter so ACA probes don't burn budget. Every authenticated response carries `X-RateLimit-{Limit,Remaining,Reset}` headers; 429 adds `Retry-After`. New `ErrorCode.RATE_LIMITED`. `build_app(..., rate_limit_per_minute=60)` default; `mdk serve --rate-limit-per-minute` flag + `MOVATE_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` env var override. Pass `0`/`None` to disable (NoOp limiter, sentinel `Limit: 0` headers signal "OFF" to operators). Redis-backed shared state slots in as a future `RateLimiter` impl when multi-replica state-sharing becomes load-bearing.

**`/ready` endpoint with deep checks shipped this session.** 3 new tests (558 unit + 3 smoke = 561 total). New `GET /ready` runs storage ping; 503 + per-check failure info if anything's broken. New `StorageProvider.ping()` method on all 3 backends (sqlite + postgres do `SELECT 1`; in-memory is a no-op). `/healthz` stays unconditional 200 (liveness). Bicep `containerapp-api.bicep` flipped to use `/ready` for the readinessProbe so ACA pulls broken pods out of rotation without restarting them. **Prevents the "30s of 500s during Postgres failover" failure mode.**

**Job retry policy shipped this session — exponential backoff + dead-letter.** 23 new tests (555 unit + 3 smoke = 558 total). New `JobStatus.DEAD_LETTER` for retry-exhausted jobs (distinct from `ERROR`). New `core/job_retry.py` module with `should_retry` / `compute_next_retry_at` / `is_exhausted` pure functions + `JobRetryPolicy` dataclass (default: 3 attempts, 5s base, 3x factor, 5min cap, ±25% jitter). `JobRecord` gained `attempt_count` + `next_retry_at` columns (idempotent sqlite + postgres migrations). New `StorageProvider.requeue_job(...)` method flips `RUNNING` → `QUEUED` with the new attempt+backoff stamped; `claim_next_job` is retry-aware (skips rows whose `next_retry_at` is in the future via a new partial index). `update_job` accepts `DEAD_LETTER` as terminal. Worker's `_resolve_outcome` centralizes the three-way decision (retry / dead-letter / terminal-error). Notifications skipped on retry path so flaky jobs don't spam ops inboxes — they only fire on a true terminal landing. `WorkerConfig.retry_policy` lets workers override the default (set `max_attempts=1` for the strict fail-fast mode). **Production-readiness gap closed.**

**Azure onboarding tooling shipped this session — `scripts/azure-bootstrap.sh` + `mdk doctor --target`.** 10 new tests (532 unit + 3 smoke = 535 total). Bash script idempotently creates RG + service principal + federated OIDC credential + role assignments per env (prints the GH Environment secrets to paste at the end). `mdk doctor --target <name>` walks `az` install → login → subscription match → RG → ACR → both Container Apps → `/healthz` with operator pointers on every red. New `docs/azure-bootstrap.md` is the 8-step end-to-end runbook from "you have a subscription" to "auto-deploy via release/*", including cost expectations and a symptom-indexed troubleshooting table. The remaining unautomated work — Azure subscription provisioning, GitHub Environment UI secret-paste, the Key Vault chicken-and-egg on first Bicep run — is each documented inline. **Removes the operator-toil gap left after stages 1-4.**

**v1.0 stage 4 shipped this session — tenant isolation audit.** 30 new test invocations (522 unit + 3 smoke = 525 total). Audit found 9 gaps in storage methods that read or mutated per-tenant rows without filtering by ``tenant_id`` — every single one now enforces tenant boundary in the SQL WHERE clause. ``get_run`` / ``get_workflow_run`` / ``get_eval`` / ``get_job`` now require ``tenant_id`` kwarg and return ``None`` for cross-tenant lookups (NOT 403, which would leak id existence). ``update_job`` / ``revoke_api_key`` / ``touch_api_key`` likewise tenant-scope the WHERE clause so even a misconfigured worker can't mutate another tenant's row. ``list_evals`` / ``list_workflow_runs`` gained the optional ``tenant_id`` filter their siblings already had. New ``tests/test_tenant_isolation.py`` parametrized over memory + sqlite + postgres mints two tenants, populates parallel rows in every table, then sweeps every cross-tenant read path asserting tenant B can never see tenant A's data — single source of truth for the multi-tenant security boundary. **v1.0 is now feature-complete.**

**v1.0 stage 3 shipped this session — model policy enforcement.** 21 new tests (492 unit + 3 smoke = 495 total). New `policy:` block on `movate.yaml` with three optional fields (`allowed_providers`, `deny_models`, `max_cost_per_run_usd`); permissive default preserves v0.x behavior for projects that don't opt in. Enforced at TWO layers: `mdk validate` (static gate on every agent.yaml — clean per-violation list with pointer back to movate.yaml) and `Executor.execute()` entry (runtime check, so bundles loaded via `mdk serve` can't bypass — denied models short-circuit BEFORE any provider call so zero cost is incurred). Aggregated violation reporting (primary + every fallback + budget checked in one pass — operator fixes everything at once). `bench`-friendly: `model_override` runs only check the override, mirroring the existing fallback-disable semantics. `PolicyViolationError` + `FailureType.POLICY_VIOLATION` for typed handling; persisted to `failures` table for audit.

**v1.0 stage 2 shipped this session — `mdk deploy` + GH Actions deploy.yml.** 23 new tests (464 unit + 3 smoke = 467 total). `cli/deploy.py` wraps `az acr build` (cloud-side image build) + `az containerapp update` for both API + worker, then polls `GET /healthz` until the new revision's `version` matches the just-built image. Image-tag default = `movate:<version>-<git-sha-short>` for traceability; `--image-tag` override for rollbacks (`--skip-build --image-tag movate:0.5.0-prev_sha`). `--only api`/`--only worker` for partial updates; `--dry-run` for plan inspection; `--no-wait` for CI fire-and-forget; `--wait-timeout` (default 300s, exit 124 on miss). `TargetConfig` extended with optional `azure_subscription` / `azure_resource_group` / `azure_acr_name` / `azure_env` fields; `add-target` accepts `--azure-*` flags and surfaces "deploy enabled / NOT enabled" at registration time. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` uses Azure federated OIDC (no stored client secrets) + per-env GitHub Environments for scoped secrets + approval gates; triggers on push to `release/<env>` or manual `workflow_dispatch` with `target_env` input. Integration surface = `az` CLI shell-out, not Azure SDKs (zero new runtime deps; operators already have `az`).

**Server-side email notifications shipped this session.** 14 new tests (441 unit + 3 smoke = 444 total). `notify_email` column on `jobs` (sqlite ALTER + postgres `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`); `JobRecord` + `RunSubmission` + `JobView` carry it through the wire. `core/notify.py` with `NotificationDispatcher` Protocol + `ConsoleBackend` (default; logs intent) + `SmtpEmailBackend` (production; vendor-agnostic — ACS Email / SendGrid / Mailgun / SES all speak SMTP). `build_dispatcher()` env-driven: `MOVATE_SMTP_HOST` unset → console; set → SMTP with STARTTLS or SSL based on `MOVATE_SMTP_USE_SSL`. Worker fires-and-awaits after terminal `update_job`; failure logs but never re-queues. `mdk submit ... --notify-email <addr>` threads through `MovateClient.submit_job` → wire → worker → SMTP. SMS deferred: blocked on multi-week A2P 10DLC / phone-number provisioning, code is the small part.

**Remote-runtime CLI ergonomics shipped this session.** 29 new tests (427 unit + 3 smoke = 430 total). `core/user_config.py` for `~/.movate/config.yaml` (deployment targets + active pointer; bearer tokens stay in env vars). `core/client.py` with `MovateClient` httpx wrapper that supports `httpx.ASGITransport` for hermetic tests. Three new CLI surfaces: `mdk config add-target | list-targets | use | show | remove-target`, `mdk submit <agent> [--target] [--wait] [--notify] [--output]`, `mdk jobs show | wait | list-agents`. `--wait` polls with a Rich spinner until terminal; `--notify` fires a desktop notification (macOS osascript / Linux notify-send / no-op on Windows). End-to-end binary smoke walked through cleanly: `config add-target` → `submit` fire-and-forget → `jobs show` → `submit --wait` returns terminal state in ~135ms.

**v1.0 stage 1 shipped this session — Azure Bicep IaC.** Locally compiles + lints clean via `az bicep build` / `az bicep lint`. Seven modular `.bicep` files (loganalytics, acr, keyvault, postgres, containerapp-env, containerapp-api, containerapp-worker) orchestrated by `infra/azure/main.bicep`. Role assignments (AcrPull, Key Vault Secrets User) wire the ACA managed identities to ACR + KV at top level. Per-env SKU defaults (`dev`/`staging`/`prod`) drive Postgres tier, ACA replicas, retention. Multi-stage `Dockerfile` with `runtime` (API) and `worker` final targets sharing one base. CI gained a `bicep` job running `bicep build` + `bicep lint` on every PR — no Azure subscription needed. Operator walkthrough at [infra/azure/README.md](infra/azure/README.md); design decisions locked in [docs/v1.0-azure-design.md](docs/v1.0-azure-design.md).

**Progress UI shipped this session.** 7 new tests (398 unit + 3 smoke = 401 total). `cli/_progress.py` with `progress_bar()`, `spinner()`, `print_event()` helpers — all stderr-only, auto-degrade on non-TTY. `EvalEngine` / `BenchEngine` / `Worker` gained optional progress callbacks that wrap user callbacks in `contextlib.suppress(Exception)` so buggy UI can never sink a run. `mdk eval` shows case-by-case bar with running mean score; `mdk bench` shows model-by-model bar; `mdk worker` shows streaming feed (`07:59:09 ✓ agent/alpha (2ms · 5fdb30de)`). Suppressed for `-o json` / `-o markdown` / `--mock` so automation paths stay clean — JSON output validity verified by tests.

**v0.5.0 tagged + released this session.** [GitHub Release](https://github.com/mova-io/mova-cli/releases/tag/v0.5.0) with wheel + sdist attached (per RELEASING.md Option A). README capability matrix flipped from staged → shipped for HTTP runtime / worker / Postgres. Service-mode quickstart added to README so the v0.5 surface is discoverable. CI gained a `postgres` job using GHA's `services:` block (Postgres 16 container) — the parametrized storage conformance suite now runs against PG on every PR, closing the "regression only caught when a dev sets MOVATE_PG_TEST_URL locally" gap.

### Group A — Close the v1.0 deploy loop (highest leverage)

The Bicep is shipped; what's missing is the **one-command deploy** that
turns a code change into a running revision. Until this lands, every
deploy is a manual `az acr build && az containerapp update` chain.

1. [x] **v1.0 stage 1: Bicep IaC for Azure** `[HIGH] [v1.0] [done]` — modular `infra/azure/modules/*.bicep`; CI runs `bicep build` + `bicep lint` on every PR. Operator walkthrough at [infra/azure/README.md](infra/azure/README.md).
2. [x] **v1.0 stage 2: `mdk deploy` CLI + GH-Actions deploy.yml** `[HIGH] [v1.0] [done]` — `mdk deploy --target <name>` wraps `az acr build` + `az containerapp update` (both API + worker) + `/healthz` poll until version matches. `TargetConfig` carries optional Azure deploy fields (`add-target --azure-*`). `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` uses federated OIDC, scoped to per-env GH Environments for approval gates. Rollback via `--skip-build --image-tag <prev>`. 23 tests across plan-building, CLI integration with subprocess mocks, and the async `/healthz` poll loop with `httpx.MockTransport`.
3. [x] **First Azure deployment validation** `[HIGH] [v1.0] [≤1d code, blocked on subscription access]` — operator runs the walkthrough against a real subscription; surface any IAM / region / SKU surprises that local Bicep compile can't catch. Onboarding tooling done this session: `scripts/azure-bootstrap.sh <env>` automates the RG + SP + federated-cred setup, `mdk doctor --target prod` walks the deploy path with operator pointers on every red, `docs/azure-bootstrap.md` is the 8-step end-to-end runbook. **Only the Azure-side action remains** (get sub, run the script, run Bicep, paste 7 secrets, push `release/dev`).
4. [x] **v1.0 stage 3: Model policy enforcement** `[HIGH] [v1.0] [done]` — `policy:` block on `movate.yaml` (allowed_providers / deny_models / max_cost_per_run_usd); enforced at `mdk validate` (static) + `Executor.execute()` entry (runtime, so bundles loaded by `mdk serve` can't bypass). Denied models short-circuit before any provider call → zero cost incurred. 21 tests in [tests/test_policy.py](tests/test_policy.py).
5. [x] **v1.0 stage 4: Tenant isolation audit** `[HIGH] [v1.0] [done]` — every storage method that touches per-tenant rows now requires + filters by ``tenant_id`` at the SQL layer (9 audit gaps closed). New ``tests/test_tenant_isolation.py`` parametrized over all 3 backends sweeps every cross-tenant read path. **v1.0 is feature-complete.**

### Group B — Scale the worker (production-readiness for real load)

The runtime works for one user at a time. To handle bursty multi-tenant
load, the worker needs to scale on **queue depth** (not CPU), retry
transient failures, and bound runaway clients.

6. [x] **KEDA Postgres scaler for worker autoscaling** `[HIGH] [post-v1.0] [done]` — replaced the CPU-utilization scale rule in `containerapp-worker.bicep` with a KEDA `postgresql` scaler keyed on claimable-job count (`status='queued' AND retry-window-elapsed`). `queueDepthPerReplica` param tunes scale-up aggression (prod 10, dev 3). New KV secret `pg-connection-string` for the KEDA sidecar.
7. [x] **Job retry policy with exponential backoff + dead-letter** `[HIGH] [post-v1.0] [done]` — `core/job_retry.py` policy module + new `JobStatus.DEAD_LETTER` + `requeue_job` storage method + worker `_resolve_outcome` decision. Transient errors (retryable=true) re-queue with exponential backoff + ±25% jitter; persistent errors stay terminal `ERROR`; budget exhaustion lands in `DEAD_LETTER`. `WorkerConfig.retry_policy` lets workers override defaults. 23 tests in [tests/test_job_retry.py](tests/test_job_retry.py) covering pure-math, storage round-trip, and worker integration.
8. [x] **Rate limiting per API key** `[MED] [post-v1.0] [done]` — token-bucket (better burst tolerance than leaky-bucket) keyed on `api_key_id`. In-process v1.x via `InProcessRateLimiter`; Redis backend slots into the same Protocol post-v1.x. Default 60 req/min/key configurable via `--rate-limit-per-minute` flag or env var. 429 with `Retry-After` + `X-RateLimit-{Limit,Remaining,Reset}` headers. 16 tests in [tests/test_rate_limit.py](tests/test_rate_limit.py).
9. [x] **`/ready` endpoint with deep checks** `[MED] [post-v1.0] [done]` — new `GET /ready` runs storage ping (sqlite `SELECT 1`, postgres pool `SELECT 1`); 503 + per-check failure info if anything's broken. `/healthz` stays unconditional 200 (liveness). Bicep `containerapp-api` readinessProbe flipped to `/ready` so ACA pulls broken pods out of rotation without restarting them. 3 tests in [tests/test_runtime_app.py](tests/test_runtime_app.py).

### Group C — SMS notifications (parallel code + business work)

The email notifications shipped this session (item 11). SMS is broken
out so you can prioritize the code + business work independently.

10. [x] **Server-side email notifications** `[MED] [post-v1.0] [done]` — `notify_email` column + `NotificationDispatcher` Protocol + Console/SMTP backends + worker hook + CLI `--notify-email`. Vendor-agnostic via SMTP.
11. [ ] **SMS-1: vendor decision (Twilio vs Azure Communication Services SMS)** `[MED] [post-v1.0] [≤2h ops]` — pricing comparison: Twilio US SMS ~$0.0079/msg + $1.15/mo phone number; ACS SMS ~$0.0075/msg + $1/mo, integrates with KV + RBAC. Decision criteria: existing Movate Twilio account? cost sensitivity? Azure-native preference? **Output: locked vendor name in `docs/v1.0-azure-design.md`.**
12. [ ] **SMS-2: code path** `[MED] [post-v1.0] [~2d, post vendor pick]` — mirrors the email path: `notify_sms` column on `jobs` (sqlite + postgres idempotent migrations), `JobRecord` + `RunSubmission` + `JobView` carry it, CLI `mdk submit ... --notify-sms +14155551212`, `SmsBackend` Protocol, `TwilioSmsBackend` or `AcsSmsBackend` depending on SMS-1, E.164 validation (regex + `phonenumbers` lib), `build_dispatcher()` composes email + SMS dispatchers if both env-configured. Tests via the same faked-vendor pattern used for SMTP.
13. [ ] **SMS-3: infra (phone-number resource + KV secrets)** `[MED] [post-v1.0] [≤0.5d, post vendor pick]` — if ACS picked: add `Microsoft.Communication/PhoneNumbers` to Bicep with E.911 address + KV secret for `ACS_CONNECTION_STRING`. If Twilio picked: just KV secrets for `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` + `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` + `TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER`. ACA worker container gets the env-var wiring.
14. [ ] **SMS-4: business setup (A2P 10DLC + sender ID approval)** `[BLOCKING] [post-v1.0] [2-3 WEEKS ops time, not code]` — **register Movate's brand + use case with The Campaign Registry (US A2P 10DLC)**; submit sender ID applications for non-US regions where customers exist. Carrier filtering can take 1-2 weeks AFTER registration approval. Should start **NOW in parallel** with code work if SMS is a real product need — code can ship and sit idle until the phone number is live; the carrier path can't be sped up. Cost: ~$50 one-time brand registration + ~$10/campaign vetting fee.
15. [ ] **SMS-5: real-SMS smoke test** `[LOW] [post-v1.0] [≤0.5d, post SMS-4 approval]` — submit a job with `--notify-sms <ops-phone>`, watch the SMS land. Out-of-pocket: ~$0.01 per smoke.

### Group D — Polish + nice-to-haves

16. [ ] **Workflow replay** `[LOW] [post-v1.0]` — `mdk run --replay <workflow-run-id>`. Single-agent replay already covers 80% of debug cases; defer until a customer asks.
17. [ ] **More templates as customer engagements demand** `[MED] [post-v1.0]` — extractor, RAG, function-caller; trivial to add now that the registry exists.
18. [ ] **HTTP streaming for `POST /run?wait=true`** `[LOW] [post-v1.0]` — server-sent events for long jobs so the client streams instead of polling. Useful for interactive UIs; not needed for the current batch / dev-team workflows.

### Group E — Next up after 2026-05-13 re-rank

> _Today closed three major lines (ADR 002 fully done; 4-dim eval shipped;
> Teams Slices 3.1.a + b + c live). This group is the **forward-looking
> Top 10** — leverage-ranked at end-of-day 2026-05-13. Groups A-D above
> are the historical priority order from earlier weeks; preserved for
> context, not the active queue._

**Ranked top-of-stack — pick from the top.** Each item is independently
shippable; nothing here is gated by anything still open.

19. [x] **Teams Slice 3.1.d — file attachment handling** `[HIGH] [v0.7] [done 2026-05-13]` — drag agent.zip / dataset.jsonl into Teams; bot validates + reports back as a card. 33 new tests. PR [#86](https://github.com/mova-io/mova-cli/pull/86). Closes [#68](https://github.com/mova-io/mova-cli/issues/68).

29. [x] **Teams Slice 3.1.e — Teams app manifest + Azure Bot Service** `[HIGH] [v0.7] [done 2026-05-13]` — Teams app manifest, appPackage zipper, two new Bicep modules + main.bicep wiring, end-to-end deploy runbook. Bicep build + lint clean; CI's bicep job catches template errors. 15 new tests. Unblocked from the Azure-migration gate because the same artifacts work against any subscription. PR [#87](https://github.com/mova-io/mova-cli/pull/87). Closes [#69](https://github.com/mova-io/mova-cli/issues/69). **Demo loop complete.**

20. [ ] **Skill-using default templates** `[HIGH] [v0.8] [≤1d]` — every `mdk init` today scaffolds a skill-less agent, so the entire Skills feature (now fully cross-runtime after ADR 002 closeout) is invisible until docs are read. Two new templates: `calc-agent` (Python skill) + `lookup-agent` (HTTP skill against a fake CRM). One of them becomes the new default. Big "first 5 minutes" demo lift for ~half a day of work. **Issue [#71](https://github.com/mova-io/mova-cli/issues/71).**

21. [ ] **v0.6 release tag + GitHub Release** `[MED] [v0.6] [≤2h]` — everything from #51 onwards (Skills + Contexts + canonical config split + native tool-use + 4-dim eval + side_effects policy) is a logical v0.6 boundary. Cut the tag, write release notes pointing at ADR 002 + the 4-dim eval section, set the README capability matrix's v0.6 row to ✓. Clarifies the v0.7 alpha boundary for what comes next. **No GH issue — just do it.**

22. [ ] **Helm chart for the runtime** `[HIGH] [v0.8] [~2d]` — `infra/helm/movate-runtime/` with Deployment + Service + Ingress + worker Deployment + HPA + KEDA Postgres scaler (mirrors what we do on ACA via Bicep). Unblocks non-Azure customers — important for partners + the Helm-deploy paths a chunk of Movate's customer base prefers. CI gains `helm lint` + `kubeval` on every PR. **Issue [#73](https://github.com/mova-io/mova-cli/issues/73).**

23. [ ] **Parallel tool-use across all three runtimes** `[MED] [v0.8] [~2d]` — modern models (Claude Sonnet 4.6+, GPT-4o) emit parallel tool calls in a single turn; today all three adapters take only the first. Executor's tool-use loop gains a multi-dispatch path via `asyncio.gather`. Cap parallel count to bound runaway models. **~3x latency improvement on multi-tool turns. Issue [#74](https://github.com/mova-io/mova-cli/issues/74).**

24. [ ] **`mdk bench` support for native_anthropic / native_openai** `[MED] [v0.8] [≤1d]` — closes a gap from ADR 002 closeout. Bench today assumes LiteLLM-style provider strings; native runtimes use bare model ids. Wire the registry/pricing-key bridge through bench; add a `--runtime litellm,native_anthropic` flag for side-by-side LiteLLM-overhead comparisons. **Issue [#75](https://github.com/mova-io/mova-cli/issues/75).**

25. [ ] **ADR 003 status flip → Accepted** `[MED] [v0.7] [≤2h]` — resolve the four open questions called out in [ADR 003](docs/adr/003-teams-integration.md) (multi-tenant prospects, Langfuse trace linking across tenants, mobile UX verification, streaming responses) based on what 3.1.a/b/c have actually demonstrated, then flip Status: Proposed → Accepted. Cheap, signals the design is stable for the rest of the v0.7 slices to land against. **No GH issue — direct doc PR.**

26. [ ] **Teams hardening — JWT validation of inbound Bot Framework requests** `[HIGH] [v1.0] [~1w]` — production-grade auth. Validates inbound JWTs against Microsoft's OpenID Connect JWKS endpoint (5-minute TTL cache); audience + issuer verification matches the bot's AAD app id. Bot Framework Emulator's "skip auth for local dev" gated by `MOVATE_TEAMS_SKIP_AUTH=1`. **Required before any public Teams app catalog rollout. Issue [#70](https://github.com/mova-io/mova-cli/issues/70).**

27. [ ] **ADR 004 — pgvector memory tiers (design)** `[HIGH] [v0.8] [~3-5d for ADR]` — unblocked by the canonical config split's `knowledge.yaml` stub. Drafts: storage layer (pgvector on existing Postgres vs separate vector DB), embedding model choice, schema for declaring which memory tier an agent reads/writes, cost-cap on embeddings, eval integration via the faithfulness/coverage dims that shipped today. Status: Proposed → reviewed → Accepted once at least one prototype validates the seam. **Issue [#76](https://github.com/mova-io/mova-cli/issues/76).**

28. [ ] **HITL workflow nodes (design)** `[MED] [v1.1+] [~3-5d for ADR]` — Phase 7 from the PRD. Pauses a workflow for an external human response, resumes on a webhook / Teams card button / email reply. Coordinates with ADR 003 — Teams Adaptive Cards with action buttons are the natural first transport. Needs design before code; one concrete use-case (refund approval) walked end-to-end. **Issue [#79](https://github.com/mova-io/mova-cli/issues/79).**

### Group F — Mova iO building-block alignment (2026-05-13)

> _Translated from the Mova iO Platform building-blocks slide. Each
> block in the slide maps to: (a) shipped in MDK, (b) partially
> shipped, (c) gap in MDK's scope to fill, or (d) explicitly NOT
> MDK's scope (e.g. Marketplace UI, Experience Platform). This group
> captures the MDK-scope gaps as concrete backlog items, ranked by
> leverage. Out-of-scope items are documented in the §F-out section
> below so the boundary is explicit._

#### F-A — Tier A: ≤1d each (quick wins)

29. [ ] **Agent metadata extension for the marketplace** `[HIGH] [v0.8] [≤1d]` — Extend `agent.yaml` schema with `persona`, `role`, `capabilities[]`, `tags[]`, `examples[]`, `owner` — all optional, backward-compatible. Marketplace UI (separate product) reads these as the source of truth for Agent Catalog / Profiles / Search / Reviews. `mdk show` renders the new fields; `mdk validate` checks them. **Unlocks the entire Agent Marketplace row of the slide. No GH issue yet — direct PR.**

30. [ ] **`mdk models` — model catalog command** `[MED] [v0.8] [≤1d]` — `mdk models list` + `mdk models show <id>`. Surfaces pricing, context window, capabilities (tools / vision), region availability, license from the existing pricing.yaml + provider registry. Closes the slide's Model Library block at the runtime layer.

31. [ ] **Open LLM + SLM templates** `[MED] [v0.8] [≤1d]` — Two new `mdk init -t` templates: `ollama-agent` (local LLM via Ollama) and `vllm-agent` (self-hosted via vLLM). Smoke test against an Ollama container in CI behind a marker. Documents the "yes we support open models / SLMs" answer with a runnable example. Closes the Open LLMs + SLMs blocks of the Model Layer.

32. [ ] **Cross-agent skill — "agent-as-tool"** `[HIGH] [v0.8] [≤1d]` — New skill kind: `agent` — declare another deployed MDK agent as a tool target. Wraps `MovateClient.submit_job` + `wait_for_terminal`. Cheapest path to the slide's Agent–Agent Integrators block. Gives multi-agent orchestration without waiting on v1.1 LangGraph + conditional edges.

#### F-B — Tier B: 2-3d each (foundational)

33. [ ] **Intent Recognition primitive** `[HIGH] [v0.8] [~2d]` — New workflow node type: `intent-router` with a declarative `routes:` map (intent → next node). Reuses classifier-agent under the hood but elevates intent routing to a first-class IR concept. Workflows can branch on intent without conditional-edge machinery (v1.1). Closes the slide's Intent Recognition block.

34. [ ] **Prompt Library** `[MED] [v0.8] [~2d]` — New `prompts/` registry dir (sibling to `skills/`) — versioned, named, importable into `agent.yaml` prompts via Jinja `{% include "kb_grounding/v3" %}`. Cross-project share via a shared-prompts package. Enables "use the company's standard customer-service tone" without copy-paste. Closes the Prompt Library block.

35. [ ] **Explainability surface — `mdk explain <run-id>`** `[HIGH] [v0.8] [~2d]` — Builds on the existing replay engine: render the decision chain (which skill called when, which tool result fed which next step, why this branch). Shipped both as CLI output and as an Adaptive Card field on the Teams bot. Closes the Explainability block — turns a checkbox into a real command.

36. [ ] **Reflection / self-critique workflow pattern** `[MED] [v0.8] [~2d]` — Reference workflow showing: agent A produces, agent B critiques, agent A revises (max N iterations). New eval dim: `reflection_score` measures whether the critique improved the output. Ships as a `reflective-agent` template + docs. Closes the Reflection block.

37. [ ] **Prompt-injection detector** `[HIGH] [v0.8] [~2d]` — New executor-entry guardrail: heuristic regex + small-LLM judge catches prompt-injection patterns in user input. Configurable in `movate.yaml: policy.input_guardrails: [prompt_injection]`. Closes the highest-stakes Safe-AI-layer gap. **Highest customer-trust impact in this tier.**

38. [ ] **Input/output PII guardrail** `[HIGH] [v0.9] [~3d]` — Filter at executor entry + exit. PII detection (emails / phones / SSNs / addresses via regex + spaCy NER). Modes: `block | redact | log-only`. `policy.io_guardrails: pii_redact`. Enterprise-table-stakes for customer-VPC deployments — pairs with the stack-defense doc.

39. [ ] **Document loaders + chunking** `[HIGH] [v0.9] [~5d, gated on ADR 004]` — `mdk knowledge ingest <path>` — PDF, MD, HTML, plain text. Pluggable chunkers (fixed, semantic, by-heading). Persists chunks + metadata to the vector store declared in `knowledge.yaml`. Closes Unstructured-data + Chunking blocks. **Depends on ADR 004 landing first.**

#### F-C — Tier C: larger / design-first

40. [ ] **ADR 005 — Fine-tuning loop** `[MED] [v0.9-v1.1] [~3-5d for ADR]` — Dataset prep from eval cases that hit a configurable score floor; hosted-job dispatch (OpenAI / Anthropic / Bedrock / Together); model registration into MDK's model catalog (item 30); eval-vs-base comparison built in. Closes the Fine-tuned LLMs block.

41. [ ] **Bias / fairness eval dims** `[MED] [v0.9] [~3d]` — Two new dim scorers: `disparate_impact` (per-group accuracy gap when dataset has a `group` field) and `consistency` (semantically-equivalent input → equivalent output). Reuses the 4-dim eval machinery from v0.6. Closes the Ethical & Responsible AI block at the eval layer.

42. [ ] **Knowledge Asset Catalog (knowledge.yaml expansion)** `[HIGH] [v0.9] [~3d]` — Declare datasets / indexes / sources in `knowledge.yaml` with versioning + lineage. `mdk knowledge list | show | diff` commands. Pairs with ADR 004 and item 39. Closes the Knowledge Asset Catalog block.

43. [ ] **Dataset quality checks** `[MED] [v0.9] [~2d]` — `mdk eval --quality` runs deduplication, near-duplicate flagging (embedding-similarity), label-distribution drift vs baseline. Surfaces "your test set has 12 near-duplicates and a class imbalance" before scoring. Closes the Data Quality block.

44. [ ] **Slack channel adapter** `[MED] [v0.9] [~3d]` — `mdk slack-bot serve`. Reuses the teams_bot scaffolding pattern (FastAPI endpoint, signature validation, per-user identity binding, cards). Second Collaboration Channel after Teams. **Issue: TBD.**

45. [ ] **Discord channel adapter** `[LOW] [post-v1] [~2d]` — Same shape as Slack. Lower priority than Slack for the enterprise audience.

46. [ ] **Model-layer guardrails** `[MED] [v1.0] [~2d]` — Token-rate caps per provider, sensitive-topic filters, max-output enforcement. Distinct from Safe-AI input/output guardrails — these are model-traffic-shaping at the provider boundary. Closes the slide's Model Layer Guardrails block.

#### F-D — Tier D: v1.2+ / longer-horizon design

47. [ ] **ADR 006 — Ontology / domain model** `[MED] [v1.2+] [~5d for ADR]` — How agents reason over structured business concepts. Schema declaration in `knowledge.yaml`; integration with retrieval + eval (semantic correctness against the ontology). Closes the Ontology block.

48. [ ] **Cross-run analytics (correlation layer)** `[MED] [v1.2] [~3d]` — BI-flavored: `mdk analytics` — cohort runs by tag / objective / tenant, regression dashboards beyond per-eval baseline diffs. Mostly delegated to Langfuse but emits the right tags upstream. Extends the Correlation & Traceability block.

49. [ ] **Graph store (Apache AGE)** `[MED] [v1.2] [~1w]` — Memory tier #2 alongside pgvector. Knowledge-graph relations as a queryable substrate. Pairs with ADR 004 and the eventual ADR 006. Closes the Graph Store block.

#### F-out — Mova iO blocks deliberately NOT MDK's scope

MDK enables these (emits metadata / runtime hooks) but the surface
itself is built elsewhere in the Mova iO stack. Listed for boundary
clarity; **no MDK backlog items**:

- **Agent Catalog / Agent Profiles / Agent Usage & Reviews / Agent Search** (Marketplace row) — Web UI reads MDK's `agent.yaml` (extended by item 29) + `mdk submit` telemetry. The Marketplace product owns the front-end + ratings + search.
- **Experience Platform / Conversational AI surfaces** (Consumption row) — Frontends call the MDK runtime over HTTP. Slack/Teams/etc. are MDK-side adapters (items 44-45 + the shipped Teams bot); the consumer experience above is product-team territory.
- **IDE** (Consumption row) — VS Code / JetBrains plugins consume MDK CLI + API. The VS Code launch configs in §10 are a thin local-dev convenience; the IDE plug-in itself sits outside MDK.
- **AI Infrastructure** (foundation row) — Bicep (shipped) + Helm (item 22) get MDK onto ACA / EKS / AKS; the substrate (cluster, network, storage classes) is platform-team territory.
- **Org-wide governance dashboards** (Ethical & Responsible AI policy UI) — MDK enforces via items 37-38 + the existing policy gate; the policy-editor UI is a separate product.

### Group G — Backend API for Mova iO Angular front end (Friday 2026-05-15 deliverable)

> _The Mova iO web app (Angular) needs HTTP endpoints to use MDK's
> evals, agent creation, and other capabilities that today live
> CLI-side. Current runtime exposes 8 endpoints (`/healthz`, `/ready`,
> `/agents` GET-only, `/run`, `/jobs`, `/jobs/{id}`, `/runs/{id}`,
> `/metrics`). This group covers the gap. **Sub-groups G-MUST and G-NEXT
> separate Friday-essential from follow-up so the team can scope
> realistically against a 2-day window.**_

#### G-cross — Cross-cutting concerns (must decide before coding)

> Get these right and the per-endpoint work is mechanical. Get them
> wrong and we'll regret it within a sprint.

50. [x] **OpenAPI client auto-gen for Angular** `[HIGH] [v0.7] [≤2h]` — FastAPI already emits an OpenAPI 3.1 spec at `/openapi.json`. Wire `ng-openapi-gen` (or `openapi-typescript-codegen`) into the Mova iO Angular repo's build so the TypeScript client is regenerated on every MDK runtime version bump. Zero hand-written DTOs. **This is the single highest-leverage decision in this group.** Without it, the Angular team writes + maintains ~30 DTO interfaces by hand.

51. [x] **CORS configuration** `[HIGH] [v0.7] [≤1h]` — FastAPI `CORSMiddleware` configured per environment via `MDK_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env var (comma-separated). Dev permissive (`*`), staging + prod locked to the Mova iO web app's hostname. **Blocks every browser call from Angular until this lands.**

52. [x] **API versioning policy** `[HIGH] [v0.7] [≤1h]` — Mount new resource endpoints under `/api/v1/` prefix (existing `/healthz`, `/ready`, `/agents`, `/run`, `/jobs/*`, `/runs/*` stay unversioned for back-compat). Document the rule: breaking changes bump to `/api/v2/`; additive changes don't. Keeps Angular's generated client stable as MDK evolves.

53. [x] **Auth model for the Angular client** `[HIGH] [v0.7] [≤2h]` — Decision needed: does the Angular app talk to MDK with (a) a single fleet API key (admin-elevated, all tenant data visible) or (b) per-user keys (`mvt_live_<user>_…`) bound via SSO? **For Friday: fleet key behind a backend-for-frontend proxy is the pragmatic call**; SSO + per-user keys is a multi-week design. The decision flips the URL pattern from `/api/v1/agents` (single-tenant view) vs `/api/v1/tenants/{id}/agents` (admin/multi-tenant view). **Decide before any endpoint lands.**

54. [x] **Pagination + filtering conventions** `[MED] [v0.7] [≤2h]` — Cursor-based pagination (`?cursor=<opaque>&limit=50`); filter via repeated query params (`?status=running&status=queued`); response envelope `{items, next_cursor, total_estimate}`. Codify once so the 10+ list endpoints don't each invent their own shape.

#### G-MUST — Friday 2026-05-15 minimum viable set

> Enough for the Angular app to: (a) list + view agents, (b) create a
> new agent from a YAML upload, (c) validate it, (d) run it with a
> payload, (e) kick off an eval and view the 4-dim scorecard. That's
> the minimum "Mova iO can build an agent" demo loop.

55. [x] **`POST /api/v1/agents` — create agent from bundle** `[HIGH] [v0.7] [≤1d]` — Accepts a multipart form with `agent.yaml` + `prompt.md` + `schema/input.json` + `schema/output.json` + optional `evals/dataset.jsonl`. Validates the bundle via existing `loader.load_agent()` logic. Persists to filesystem-backed agent registry (today: `./agents/` dir). Returns the agent's resolved spec + a marketplace metadata block (item 29 fields). **Two-step on conflict:** 409 if name exists; PUT for update.

56. [x] **`GET /api/v1/agents/{name}` — full agent spec + bundle metadata** `[HIGH] [v0.7] [≤2h]` — Extends today's `/agents` (which is list-only) with per-agent detail: spec JSON + prompt body + I/O schemas + dataset stats + marketplace metadata + last-known eval scores. Mirrors `mdk show` output. **The Angular agent-profile view reads this single endpoint.**

57. [ ] **`PUT /api/v1/agents/{name}` — update agent bundle** `[HIGH] [v0.7] [≤1d]` — Same multipart shape as POST but updates in-place. Bumps `version` on every update (semver minor by default; major if breaking schema change detected). Returns the new resolved spec.

58. [x] **`POST /api/v1/agents/{name}/validate` — schema + prompt-linter** `[HIGH] [v0.7] [≤2h]` — Wraps `mdk validate` programmatically. Returns `{errors: [], warnings: [], cost_forecast: {...}}`. Errors block save; warnings let the UI render a yellow chip but don't block. **Drives the "is this agent shippable?" UI gate.**

59. [x] **`POST /api/v1/agents/{name}/runs` — agent-scoped run** `[HIGH] [v0.7] [≤2h]` — Equivalent to today's `POST /run` but URL-anchored on the agent (REST-clean for Angular's resource-oriented mental model). Body: `{input: {...}}`. Sync (`?wait=true`, returns `RunView`) or async (default, returns `{job_id}` + 202).

60. [ ] **`POST /api/v1/agents/{name}/evals` — kick off an eval run** `[HIGH] [v0.7] [≤1d]` — Wraps `mdk eval`. Body: `{gate: 0.7, runs: 3, mock: false, baseline_id?: "...", regression_tolerance?: 0.05}`. Returns `{eval_id, status: queued}` immediately; eval runs as a background job (reuses worker infra). Poll via `GET /api/v1/evals/{eval_id}`. **Closes the eval kickoff path from Angular.**

61. [ ] **`GET /api/v1/evals/{eval_id}` — eval record + 4-dim scorecard** `[HIGH] [v0.7] [≤2h]` — Full `EvalRecord` JSON: per-case rows, dimensional means (accuracy / faithfulness / coverage / latency), baseline diff if applicable. Mirrors the `mdk eval` Rich table but as structured data for Angular's chart rendering.

62. [ ] **`GET /api/v1/evals?agent={name}` — eval history list** `[HIGH] [v0.7] [≤2h]` — Paginated. Each row: eval_id, agent_name, gate, gate_mode, mean_score, pass_rate, created_at, status. Drives the "evals over time" chart Angular will render.

63. [ ] **`GET /api/v1/agents` enhancement — marketplace facets + filters** `[HIGH] [v0.7] [≤2h]` — Extends today's `/agents` (basic name+version list) with marketplace metadata (role / persona / capabilities / tags / examples from item 29), filterable by `?role=...&capabilities=...&tags=...`. **Drives the Mova iO Agent Catalog page directly.**

#### G-NEXT — Follow-up endpoints (next sprint)

64. [ ] **`POST /api/v1/bench/{agent}` + `GET /api/v1/bench/{bench_id}`** `[HIGH] [v0.8] [~1d]` — Multi-model comparison kickoff + retrieval. Mirrors `mdk bench`.

65. [x] **`GET /api/v1/runs/{run_id}/trace` — replay info** `[HIGH] [v0.8] [≤1d]` — Mirrors `mdk trace replay`. Returns timeline JSON (spans, costs, decisions) for Angular's trace-viewer component.

66. [ ] **`GET /api/v1/runs/{run_id}/explain` — decision chain** `[MED] [v0.8] [≤1d, depends on item 35]` — Mirrors `mdk explain` (item 35). Skill calls, tool results, branch decisions in human-readable form. **Pairs with item 35 from Group F.**

67. [ ] **`GET /api/v1/models` + `GET /api/v1/models/{id}` — model catalog** `[MED] [v0.8] [≤1d, depends on item 30]` — Pricing, context window, capabilities, region availability. **Pairs with item 30 from Group F.**

68. [ ] **`GET /api/v1/pricing` — pricing table** `[MED] [v0.8] [≤2h]` — Read-only mirror of `pricing.yaml`. Lets Angular render cost-forecast UI client-side without round-tripping.

69. [ ] **Skills CRUD: `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/v1/skills` + `POST /api/v1/skills/{name}/invoke`** `[MED] [v0.8] [~2d]` — Wraps `mdk skills *` commands. Skill registry browsing + direct invocation from the Angular skill-authoring UI.

70. [ ] **Workflows CRUD: `/api/v1/workflows` + `POST /api/v1/workflows/{name}/runs`** `[MED] [v0.8] [~2d]` — Mirrors `mdk` workflow surface. Topology JSON for Angular's flowchart renderer.

71. [ ] **Datasets endpoint: `POST /api/v1/agents/{name}/dataset`** `[MED] [v0.8] [≤1d]` — Upload / replace `evals/dataset.jsonl`. Mirrors the Teams bot's file-attachment validation (slice 3.1.d). Returns row count + preview.

72. [ ] **Tenant admin: `GET/POST /api/v1/tenants/{id}/budget`, `GET /api/v1/tenants/{id}/usage`** `[MED] [v0.8] [≤1d]` — Wraps `mdk tenants *`. Admin-only (RBAC needed before public exposure).

73. [ ] **API keys CRUD: `GET/POST/DELETE /api/v1/auth/keys`** `[MED] [v0.8] [≤1d]` — Wraps `mdk auth create-key | list-keys | revoke-key`. Admin-only.

74. [x] **`GET /api/v1/jobs?agent={}&status={}&tenant={}` — filterable job history** `[MED] [v0.8] [≤2h]` — Extends today's `/jobs` with filtering + cursor pagination. Drives Angular's run-history table.

75. [ ] **Server-Sent Events for long jobs: `GET /api/v1/jobs/{id}/events`** `[LOW] [post-v1] [~1d]` — Streams status transitions + cost updates. Useful for the agent-run UX where polling feels laggy. Defer until the polling experience is actually a problem.

#### G-v1 — v1 deliverable: three pillars (refined 2026-05-13 PM)

> _Replaces the original G-est scope. The Friday demo is no longer
> "agent CRUD + a basic eval card." The v1 Angular-compatible
> endpoint set is now three pillars, each load-bearing for a
> specific Mova iO UI flow:_
>
> **Pillar 1: Agent creation** — canonical folder structure + GitHub
> integration so created agents are version-controlled from day one.
> Not just `POST /agents` — the full bundle layout + git push pipeline.
>
> **Pillar 2: Evals** — kickoff + retrieval + history. Mostly covered
> by items 60-62; nothing new needed here beyond what's already in
> G-MUST.
>
> **Pillar 3: Observability** — runs, traces, replay surfaced via API.
> Items 65 (`GET /runs/{id}/trace`) and 74 (filterable jobs) move
> from G-NEXT → v1. Item 66 (`explain`) stays in G-NEXT (depends on
> Group F item 35 design work).
>
> Marketplace facets (item 63), PUT update (item 57), bench (item 64),
> models catalog, skills/workflows CRUD, tenant admin, API keys all
> defer to v0.8 — the v1 demo doesn't need them.

##### Pillar 1: Agent creation with canonical folders + GitHub version control

The existing items 55-58 cover the in-process side. **The GitHub
piece is new** — these endpoints below close the version-control gap.

76. [x] **`POST /api/v1/agents` accepts a canonical bundle** `[HIGH] [v0.7] [~1d]` — Refines item 55. The endpoint persists agents in the canonical folder layout MDK already uses (`<agent-name>/agent.yaml` + `prompt.md` + `schema/{input,output}.json` + `evals/dataset.jsonl` + optional `skills/`, `contexts/`, `prompts/`, `knowledge.yaml`). The endpoint accepts EITHER (a) a multipart form with the individual files, or (b) a zipped bundle (multipart form `bundle.zip` field). Returns the canonical layout in the response so the Angular UI can render "your agent is now at `agents/faq-bot/...`". **Rejects bundles that violate the canonical layout** so we never persist a malformed structure to git.

77. [x] **ADR 007 — GitHub integration for agent version control** `[HIGH] [v0.7] [~3d ADR + impl]` — Design before code. Decisions: (a) one repo per agent vs one repo with subdirs? (b) GitHub App vs PAT auth? (c) commit-on-every-save vs explicit "publish" button? (d) PR-based review or direct push to main? **Recommend: one mono-repo per tenant (`mova-io-agents-<tenant>`); GitHub App auth for org installs; explicit publish action (NOT auto-commit on every save — too noisy); direct push to main with branch protection for sensitive agents.** Write the ADR Thursday, ship the code Friday.

78. [x] **`POST /api/v1/agents/{name}/publish` — commit + push to GitHub** `[HIGH] [v0.7] [done 2026-05-13]` — Feature-flagged via `MDK_GITHUB_ENABLED=1` so the live runtime is unaffected until ops registers the GitHub App + sets the secrets. New `src/movate/integrations/github.py` module: `GitHubConfig.from_env`, JWT-RS256 App auth (hand-rolled signing — no PyJWT dep), 5-minute-buffer installation-token cache, 5-step Git Data API push (blobs → tree-with-base_tree → commit-with-parent → ref PATCH). One bundle = one commit; dot-prefixed files excluded. Endpoint advertises in `/openapi.json` regardless of flag state so the Angular client can generate against it now. 29 new tests via `httpx.MockTransport` — no live network. Idempotency (`no_changes: true`) deferred to a follow-up.

79. [x] **`GET /api/v1/agents/{name}/history`** `[HIGH] [v0.7] [done 2026-05-14]` — Feature-flagged via `MDK_GITHUB_ENABLED=1`, same gate as item 78. Added `list_history(target_dir, limit, page)` on `GitHubClient` — calls `GET /repos/.../commits?path=<dir>&per_page&page` with `per_page` clamped to GitHub's 100 max. New `CommitInfo` dataclass + `AgentCommitView` / `AgentHistoryView` Pydantic wire models. Endpoint flattens the nested GitHub response into the simple shape the UI wants (sha, message, author_name/email, timestamp, html_url). Empty commit lists return 200 with empty array (not 404 — "no history yet" is a valid state for a wizard-created agent). `has_more` heuristic surfaces a "Load more" button hint when the page is full. The `_api` helper got split into `_request` (Any return), `_api` (dict), `_api_list` (list) to support the new endpoint cleanly. 19 new tests (12 integration + 7 endpoint). `?since=<sha>` cursor deferred to a v0.8 follow-up.

80. [ ] **`POST /api/v1/agents/{name}/revert?to_sha=<sha>`** `[MED] [v0.7] [≤1d, gated on ADR 007]` — Resets the working bundle to a prior commit's content and re-commits forward (NOT `git reset --hard` — preserves history). Returns the new commit SHA. Use case: "this last edit broke the eval, roll back to yesterday's version."

81. [ ] **Repo provisioning command: `mdk github bootstrap`** `[MED] [v0.7] [≤1d, gated on ADR 007]` — Operator one-time setup. Creates the per-tenant `mova-io-agents-<tenant>` repo (or attaches to an existing one), installs the GitHub App, writes the integration config into `~/.mdk/config.yaml` under `github:`. **Friday: optional polish** — the v1 demo can land with a manually-provisioned repo + pasted credentials; this CLI wraps the setup for production rollout.

##### Pillar 3: Observability via API (moved up from G-NEXT)

These three were originally G-NEXT (v0.8); promoted to v1 per the
new scope.

* Item 65 (`GET /api/v1/runs/{run_id}/trace`) — promote to v1
* Item 74 (`GET /api/v1/jobs?agent={}&status={}&tenant={}`) — promote to v1
* Item 75 (SSE for long jobs) — **stays deferred** (nice-to-have; polling is fine for v1)

#### G-est — Friday scope estimate (UPDATED 2026-05-13 PM)

Realistic delivery for the v1 Angular-compatible deliverable in the
remaining Wed PM → Fri window:

**Wednesday PM (today, done):**
* ✅ Items 50-54 G-cross (shipped via PR #94)

**Thursday — agent creation core + observability:**
* Item 76 — `POST /api/v1/agents` with canonical layout (~3h)
* Item 77 — ADR 007 GitHub integration design (~4h, parallel with the above)
* Item 56 — `GET /api/v1/agents/{name}` (~2h)
* Item 58 — `POST /api/v1/agents/{name}/validate` (~2h)
* Item 59 — `POST /api/v1/agents/{name}/runs` (~2h)
* Item 65 — `GET /api/v1/runs/{run_id}/trace` (~2h)
* Item 74 — `GET /api/v1/jobs?...` enhancement (~1h)

**Friday — GitHub publish + evals + integration test:**
* Item 78 — `POST /api/v1/agents/{name}/publish` (~3h)
* Item 79 — `GET /api/v1/agents/{name}/history` (~2h)
* Item 60 — `POST /api/v1/agents/{name}/evals` (~3h)
* Item 61 — `GET /api/v1/evals/{eval_id}` (~2h)
* Item 62 — `GET /api/v1/evals?agent={name}` (~1h)
* Integration smoke + buffer (~2h)

**Stretch (if time allows on Friday PM):**
* Item 80 — revert endpoint (~1h)
* Item 81 — `mdk github bootstrap` CLI (~2h)

**Deferred to v0.8 (NOT in Friday v1):**
* Item 55 → superseded by item 76
* Item 57 — `PUT /api/v1/agents/{name}` (use revert + publish + new POST for now)
* Item 63 — marketplace facets (the Catalog UI uses item 56's per-agent metadata for now)
* Items 64, 66-73, 75 — all G-NEXT items not promoted above

Total realistic v1 surface: **~12 endpoints + 1 ADR + ~3 CLI helpers**. The Angular team can continue scaffolding against the OpenAPI spec — every endpoint that lands adds a typed service method via `npm run client:gen`.

### Group H — Friday demo prep with Deva's Mova iO wizard (2026-05-13 PM discovery)

> _Adds items surfaced by Deva's "Onboard Agent" wizard screenshot.
> The wizard collects fields in a shape that **doesn't match MDK's
> canonical agent.yaml directly** — without a translation layer his
> Angular `POST /api/v1/agents` calls would 422. The wizard sends
> inline prompt (no file), omits I/O schemas entirely, and includes
> fields MDK doesn't track (Agent Provider, Agent Type, AI Foundation).
> Item 82 ships the bridge; the rest are demo-prep + next-sprint
> follow-ups._

#### H-MUST — Required for Friday meeting

82. [x] **`POST /api/v1/agents/from-wizard` — Mova iO wizard adapter** `[HIGH] [v0.7] [~3h]` — Sibling endpoint to `POST /api/v1/agents` accepting `application/json` (not multipart). Body matches the wizard's field set: ``{name, agent_provider, agent_type, role, description, agent_role, agent_goal, agent_prompt, reference_output, mcp_connectors, knowledge_store, ai_model, ai_foundation}``. Translates into the canonical layout: prompt body → `prompt.md`, default I/O schemas (input: free-form text, output: free-form response), wizard-specific fields → marketplace metadata + tag extensions. Delegates to existing `persist_bundle()`. Returns same `AgentCreatedView` so the Angular client doesn't branch.

83. [x] **`POST /api/v1/agents/{name}/evals` — eval kickoff as Azure worker job** `[HIGH] [v0.7] [~3h]` — Originally item 60. Refined: new `JobKind.EVAL` + worker dispatch handler that loads the agent bundle, runs `EvalEngine`, persists `EvalRecord` to Postgres, updates job progress per case. Endpoint returns ``{eval_id, job_id, status: queued}``; Angular polls `GET /api/v1/evals/{eval_id}` (item 84).

84. [x] **`GET /api/v1/evals/{eval_id}` — eval scorecard (running or done)** `[HIGH] [v0.7] [~2h]` — Originally item 61. Returns the partial-or-final `EvalRecord`: per-case rows + dimensional means (accuracy / faithfulness / coverage / latency) + baseline diff if applicable. Works while the eval is still running (shows ``cases_completed: 23 / 50``).

85. [x] **`GET /api/v1/evals?agent=<name>` — eval history list** `[HIGH] [v0.7] [~1h]` — Originally item 62. Paginated. Each row: ``{eval_id, agent_name, gate, mean_score, pass_rate, created_at, status}``.

86. [x] **Deploy v0.7 to Azure ACA** `[HIGH] [v0.7] [~1h operator action]` — Build a fresh image (`movate:0.7.0-<sha>`) via `az acr build`, redeploy `movate-dev-rg` runtime so today's new endpoints (76, 56, 58, 59, 65, 74) + Friday's (82-85) are live. Update `MDK_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to include Deva's Mova iO origin. Smoke test `/openapi.json` returns all v1 routes.

87. [x] **Mint API key for Deva + send onboarding bundle** `[HIGH] [v0.7] [~30min]` — `az containerapp exec` → `mdk auth create-key --tenant deva-friday-demo --env live --label angular-bff`. Send Deva: (a) runtime URL, (b) bearer token, (c) link to `docs/angular-client.md` for client-gen instructions, (d) `/openapi.json` URL.

88. [x] **Smoke-test runbook: wizard → eval → trace round-trip** `[MED] [v0.7] [~1h]` — Single doc walking the full Angular flow against the deployed runtime: hit `/from-wizard` → `/validate` → kick off eval → poll → fetch trace. Confirms every Friday-demo path works end-to-end BEFORE the meeting.

#### H-NEXT — Next sprint (post-Friday)

89. [ ] **Per-job progress counters on JobRecord** `[MED] [v0.8] [~2d]` — Adds `progress_total` + `progress_completed` integer columns to the jobs table. Eval worker updates per case so the Angular UI can render "23/50 cases done" without polling for the full EvalRecord every second. Pairs with item 75 (SSE) for the streaming variant.

90. [ ] **Webhook callbacks on terminal status** `[MED] [v0.8] [~3d]` — Alternative to polling for the Angular BFF: at job submit time accept a `webhook_url` field; on terminal status the worker POSTs to that URL with the job payload. Signed via HMAC for verification. Lets the Mova iO BFF be event-driven instead of poll-driven.

91. [ ] **Wizard field set → AgentSpec migration (rounded out)** `[MED] [v0.8] [~2d]` — Promote `agent_provider`, `agent_type`, `ai_foundation` from tag-extensions (today's shape in item 82) to first-class `AgentSpec` fields. Adds validators + `mdk show` rendering + marketplace UI surfaces.

92. [ ] **Inline-prompt support on `POST /api/v1/agents` (multipart variant)** `[LOW] [v0.8] [~1h]` — Accept a `prompt_text` form field as an alternative to a `prompt` file upload — convenience for callers who don't want to construct a multipart-with-file payload. Item 82 covers the JSON path; this covers operators who use curl + multipart but don't want to manage temp files.

93. [ ] **Schema auto-generation from prompt + reference output** `[MED] [v0.8] [~2d]` — When the wizard omits schemas (today: default to free-form), an LLM-judge run could infer reasonable I/O schemas from `agent_prompt` + `reference_output`. Optional, gated by a `--generate-schemas` flag on the from-wizard endpoint.

94. [ ] **Mova iO BFF reference implementation** `[MED] [v0.8] [~3d]` — Sample Node.js / Python BFF that demonstrates the auth pattern from ADR 003 (Angular session → BFF → MDK fleet key). Includes CORS handling, error mapping, and the wizard payload validator. Shipped as a docs sample, not a runtime.

#### H-est — Wed PM → Fri morning realistic schedule

**Wed PM (today, this session):**
* Item 82 — `POST /api/v1/agents/from-wizard` (~3h)

**Thursday:**
* Item 83 — eval kickoff endpoint (~3h)
* Item 84 — eval retrieval (~2h)
* Item 85 — eval history list (~1h)
* Item 86 — deploy to Azure (~1h, operator)

**Friday morning:**
* Item 87 — mint Deva's key + send onboarding (~30min)
* Item 88 — smoke-test runbook (~1h)
* Meeting prep / live debugging buffer

**Stretch (if Pillar 1+2+3 sticks the landing):**
* Items 78, 79 (GitHub publish + history) — Pillar 1's GitHub layer

### Group I — Surfaced by 2026-05-13 PM smoke + deploy

> _Triage discoveries from running scripts/friday-demo-deploy.sh + smoking
> all 12 deva-curl wrappers against the live runtime. Most are small (~30
> min to ~3h) but unblock either Friday demo polish or production
> rollout. Tier per item: F = Friday-critical, R = before Mova iO ships,
> U = usability polish._

#### I-F — Friday-meeting critical

109. [ ] **Cross-pod bundle sync** `[HIGH] [v0.7] [~3-4h or workaround ~2h]` — Tier F. Wizard-created agents land on the API pod's filesystem; the worker pod can't see them. Smoke proof: `POST /api/v1/agents/from-wizard` for `smoke-bot` returned 201, but `POST /api/v1/agents/smoke-bot/runs` queued a job that the worker errored with `unknown_agent: agent 'smoke-bot' not registered on this worker`. Two fix paths: (a) mount an Azure Files share at `/home/movate/agents` on both pods (proper, ~3-4h Bicep + integration test), (b) inline-run mode at the endpoint to sidestep the issue for the Mova iO demo (item 110, ~2h). Recommend (b) for Friday, (a) for v0.8.

110. [x] **Inline run mode — `POST /api/v1/agents/{name}/runs?wait=true`** `[HIGH] [v0.7] [~2h]` — Tier F. Same pattern the eval endpoint already uses: when `?wait=true`, execute the agent inline at the API endpoint and return the RunRecord directly (200). When omitted (default), preserve today's async/worker behavior (202 + job_id). Sidesteps the cross-pod bundle issue (item 109) for wizard-created agents while keeping the queue path for production load. Two tests: sync mode returns 200 with output dict; async mode returns 202 + job_id; both routed through the same Executor.

111. [ ] **`POST /api/v1/agents/{name}/dataset` — upload after create** `[HIGH] [v0.7] [~1h]` — Tier F. Promoted from item 71 because wizard-created agents have no dataset and thus can't be eval'd. Multipart upload of `evals/dataset.jsonl`; validates JSONL shape (one JSON object per line); returns `{row_count, sha256_prefix, preview: [first-3-rows]}`. Refreshes the in-memory registry post-upload like the create endpoint does.

#### I-R — Production rollout (before Mova iO publishes anything customer-facing)

112. [ ] **HTTP-based API key management** `[HIGH] [v0.8] [~1d]` — Tier R. Today's key minting requires `az containerapp exec` + a pseudo-tty workaround (`script -q /dev/null`). HTTP endpoint surface: `POST /api/v1/auth/keys`, `GET /api/v1/auth/keys`, `DELETE /api/v1/auth/keys/{id}`. Admin-only (gated on a fleet-admin scope on the calling key). Eliminates the operator-hostile container-exec path. Pairs with item 73.

113. [ ] **Bearer token expiry + rotation** `[HIGH] [v0.8] [~2d]` — Tier R. Today's `mvt_live_...` keys live forever. Add `expires_at` column to api_keys; default 90-day TTL; reject expired keys at auth middleware with a clear `expired` error code; `mdk auth rotate` command to mint a replacement and deprecate the old key with a 7-day grace window. Required before any non-Movate user (Deva's customers) get keys.

114. [ ] **E2E smoke against deployed runtime in CI** `[MED] [v0.8] [~1d]` — Tier R. New GH Actions workflow `e2e-smoke.yml` runs `scripts/deva-curl/*.sh` against a staging deployment on every merge to main. Would have caught today's cross-pod issue (item 109) before the live deploy. Requires a long-lived staging runtime + a CI-scoped bearer. Gated on staging env existing.

115. [x] **Pre-deploy lockfile validator** `[MED] [v0.8] [~30min]` — Tier R. CI check that `uv lock --check` passes — fails if `pyproject.toml` declares deps not in `uv.lock`. Would have caught today's python-multipart drift before the failed deploy (cost ~30 min). One-line GH Actions step.

#### I-U — Usability polish (small wins, each <½ day)

116. [x] **`MDK_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` as Bicep parameter** `[MED] [v0.7] [done 2026-05-13]` — Tier U. Threaded `corsAllowedOrigins` through `main.bicep` → `containerapp-api.bicep` so the deploy is idempotent in one Bicep apply (no more post-deploy `az containerapp update --set-env-vars` step). `scripts/friday-demo-deploy.sh` collapsed from 6 steps to 5 — passes the allow-list through `--parameters corsAllowedOrigins=` directly. Param doc explains the empty-string default + Friday Mova iO demo example.

117. [ ] **DELETE `/api/v1/agents/{name}`** `[MED] [v0.7] [~1h]` — Tier U. No clean way to remove a wizard-created agent today (operator has to `az containerapp exec` + `rm -rf`). Auth-gated; soft-delete (move to `.deleted-<name>-<timestamp>/` sibling for 7-day recovery window, then cron sweep) keeps the safety net.

118. [x] **Improved `unknown_agent` error from worker** `[LOW] [v0.7] [done 2026-05-13]` — Tier U. Added `hint` field to `ErrorInfo` (optional, defaults to `None`); worker's `unknown_agent` path now points callers at the cross-pod bundle-sync gap (item 109) and the `?wait=true` workaround (item 110). Wire-format propagation is automatic — `JobView.error` is `ErrorInfo | None`, so polled `GET /api/v1/jobs/{id}` responses surface the hint without further plumbing. One new assertion in `test_dispatch_unknown_agent_is_terminal_error`.

119. [x] **Bump package version to 0.7.0** `[MED] [v0.7] [~15min]` — Tier U. `pyproject.toml` + `src/movate/__init__.py` still say `0.5.0`. `/healthz` reports it as the runtime version, which is misleading after all of today's work. Bump to 0.7.0 + tag the v0.7.0 GitHub release (item 21).

120. [x] **`/api/v1/openapi.json` (versioned alias)** `[LOW] [v0.8] [done 2026-05-13]` — Tier U. Added unauthenticated alias that returns the same spec as the unversioned `/openapi.json` (no v1-filtered subset — the spec self-describes via per-route paths). `include_in_schema=False` so the alias doesn't show up in its own spec. Two new tests assert equality + unauthenticated reachability.

#### I-est — Recommended pickup order

**Tonight or early Thursday (Tier F, ~3-4h):**
* 110 — Inline run mode (sidesteps cross-pod issue for the demo)
* 111 — Dataset upload (makes wizard agents eval-able)
* 119 — Version bump (one line, cosmetic but honest)
* BACKLOG hygiene (this PR)

**Thursday (Tier U + Friday polish):**
* 116 — CORS as Bicep param (cleaner re-deploys)
* 117 — DELETE agent endpoint
* 115 — `uv lock --check` in CI

**Post-Friday (Tier R, in priority order):**
* 109 — Real cross-pod filesystem (Azure Files)
* 112 — HTTP key management
* 113 — Bearer expiry + rotation
* 114 — E2E CI smoke
* 26 — Teams JWT validation
* 78-81 — GitHub publish/history/revert/bootstrap
* 37 + 38 — Prompt-injection + PII guardrails

### Group J — Mova iO Mapping Push (2026-05-14)

> _Tomorrow-demo push to close the 30% gap surfaced when Deva asked us
> to map every Mova iO platform building-block to MDK. Two items
> already shipped as pre-work (mdk add + role templates, project-mode
> validate/eval); the remaining six phases are the active queue, sized
> so the whole push fits in a focused day. Each phase = its own PR.
> Phase 0 = biggest visible win (Safe AI MVP); RAG ships intentionally
> minimal (surface only, real engine waits for the v0.8 RAG sprint)._

**Reference:** the layer-by-layer Mova iO scorecard lives in `docs/mova-io-mapping.md` (Phase J-7 produces it).

#### J-pre — Pre-work already shipped this session

121. [x] **`mdk add` + 5 role templates** `[HIGH] [v0.7] [done 2026-05-14] [~1h]` — PR [#5](https://github.com/mova-io/mova-cli/pull/5). Project-aware role-based scaffolder (`mdk add <name> --template <role>`) + five day-one personas (support-triage, sql-writer, reply-drafter, text-classifier, document-summarizer). Each role ships marketplace metadata + rubric-driven prompt + 2-3 case eval dataset + ROLE.md. `--list-roles` / `--list-roles --json` powers the Mova iO wizard's "Choose a template" dropdown. Closes Deva's Tier-1 ask: "after `mdk init`, want to add agents by template type, e.g. `mdk add my-project my-role-agent-name --template ocr`."

122. [x] **`mdk validate --project` / `mdk eval --project`** `[HIGH] [v0.7] [done 2026-05-14] [~1h]` — PR [#6](https://github.com/mova-io/mova-cli/pull/6). Team-level gates Deva asked for in the Mova iO mapping. Walks `<root>/agents/*`, runs validate (or eval) per-agent, prints a rolled-up summary table, exits non-zero if any fails. Per-agent failures don't abort the loop — operator sees ALL failures at once. Path defaults to walk-up from cwd for `movate.yaml`. CI-friendly: gate a whole project with one command + one exit code.

#### J-0 to J-5 — Active queue (today)

123. [ ] **Phase 0: Safe AI MVP (PII + topic + content guardrails)** `[HIGH] [v0.7] [next] [~3h]` — Lyzr-equivalence on the RAI tab. New `guardrails:` block in `movate.yaml` with three modules: PII (regex-based redact/block/warn for email/phone/SSN/credit-card), topic restriction (allowlist; LLM-judged on violation), content filter (profanity regex; off-topic flag). Wired at `Executor.execute()` entry (input) + exit (output). Reuses existing `safety_blocked` status — pipeline already propagates it through workflow runner / worker / RemoteExecutor / `RunRecord`. MVP tradeoffs: regex over spaCy/moderation-API; swap-in-able later via the same interface. Closes the biggest Mova iO mapping gap (Safe AI layer was 40% covered, this moves it to ~80%).

124. [ ] **Phase 1: Reflection pattern (judge-in-the-loop)** `[MED] [v0.7] [~2h]` — New `reflection:` block in `AgentSpec`: `enabled`, `judge_model`, `rubric`, `max_iterations: 1` for MVP. After primary call, Executor calls the judge with output + rubric; if judge says "revise," loops once. Hooks into existing tracing — judge call is a separate span under the agent span. Demonstrates on `sql-writer` role (checks SQL is read-only + parses). Multi-turn reflection (3+ rounds) waits for the next iteration. Maps to Mova iO platform's "Reflection" box.

125. [ ] **Phase 2: `mdk explain <run-id>`** `[MED] [v0.7] [~2h]` — Operator-facing run summarizer. Reads RunRecord from storage, renders a Rich panel showing prompt sent / response / retries / fallbacks fired / cost / latency / schema validation result / guardrail verdicts. Optional one-paragraph LLM-generated plain-English "why" summary (cheap call; `--no-summary` opt-out). Maps to Mova iO's "Explainability" box. Pairs with item 122 — `mdk eval --project` surfaces a failing agent; `mdk explain` zooms into the specific run.

126. [ ] **Phase 3: `mdk plan --from "<description>"` MVP** `[HIGH] [v0.7] [~3h]` — The "wow demo" Deva put on the wishlist. Reads role + skill catalogs, calls a planner LLM, emits a JSON plan (`agents: [{name, template, purpose}], skills: [...], contexts: [...], workflow: [...]`). `--dry-run` (default) prints the plan + cost estimate + tree preview; `--apply` programmatically calls `mdk init` + `mdk add` + `mdk scaffold tool` to scaffold the project. MVP tradeoffs: no domain-specific prompt rewrite per agent (uses role-template prompts as-is); no HITL refinement loop; one planner call (no CoT decomposition). Maps to Mova iO's "Planning" box.

127. [ ] **Phase 4: RAG surface (knowledge.yaml + in-memory retriever)** `[MED] [v0.7] [~3h, surface only]` — **Intentionally minimal**: 3-4 week sprint compressed to surface design. Promotes `KnowledgeConfig` from stub to working parser; `src/movate/knowledge/{loader,retriever,store}.py`; in-memory BM25/substring retriever (no embeddings); `mdk knowledge {add,list,query}` commands; workflow node type `retriever`. **Does NOT ship**: embeddings (TODO: pgvector / Azure AI Search in v0.8), reranking, PDF/Word/HTML ingestion (markdown only), semantic chunking, graph store. Locks in the interface so the production engine slots in without API breakage. Maps to most of Mova iO's "Data & Knowledge" column.

128. [ ] **Phase 5: Mova iO mapping doc + PPT slide** `[HIGH] [v0.7] [~1h]` — `docs/mova-io-mapping.md` — the layer-by-layer scorecard mapping every Mova iO platform box to its MDK status (have / partial / roadmap / out-of-scope). Generated PPT slide via `scripts/build-deva-ppt.py` for the Friday meeting. Durable artifact: regenerates as features ship, replacing the version-of-truth from the on-the-fly mapping I gave Deva in chat.

#### J-est — Pickup order

**Tonight (Phase J-0 + J-1, ~5h):**
* J-0 — Safe AI MVP (the show-stopper for the demo)
* J-1 — Reflection pattern

**Tomorrow AM (J-2 + J-3, ~5h):**
* J-2 — `mdk explain`
* J-3 — `mdk plan --from`

**Tomorrow PM (J-4 + J-5, ~4h):**
* J-4 — RAG surface
* J-5 — Mapping doc + PPT

**Total budget: 14h focused work** — doable for tomorrow if I commit. Each phase ships its own PR; if J-3 or J-4 bog down on prompt-engineering / interface design, ship strictly-scoped versions with `TODO: phase 2` markers rather than skip.

## 2. Evals & comparison (Phase 2 / v0.2)

### Shipped

- [x] **Eval engine — exact-match scorer** `[HIGH] [v0.2] [done]` — `EvalEngine` in [src/movate/core/eval.py](src/movate/core/eval.py); 30 unit tests.
- [x] **Eval engine — LLM-as-judge with cross-family enforcement** `[HIGH] [v0.2] [done]` — same module; `assert_cross_family()` raises at config time. Azure↔OpenAI treated as same family.
- [x] **`mdk eval` with `--gate 0.7` exit-code semantics** `[HIGH] [v0.2] [done]` — Rich table + JSON output, exit 0/1 by gate.
- [x] **N runs per case + aggregation modes** `[HIGH] [v0.2] [done]` — `--runs N --gate-mode mean|min|p10`; mean default.
- [x] **Eval result persistence (sqlite `evals` table)** `[MED] [v0.2] [done]` — `EvalRecord` saved on every run; index on `(agent, created_at)`.
- [x] **Dataset hashing + `dataset_hash` on EvalRecord** `[MED] [v0.2] [done]` — sha256 of dataset bytes stamped per run.
- [x] **Judge config validation at parse time** `[MED] [v0.2] [done]` — `JudgeConfig` Pydantic + `EvalEngine._validate_judge` rejects same-family before any case runs.
- [x] **judge.yaml.example in template** `[MED] [v0.2] [done]` — dropped in `evals/judge.yaml.example`; rename to enable.

### More shipped

- [x] **`mdk bench` (multi-model compare)** `[HIGH] [v0.2] [done]` — `BenchEngine` in [src/movate/core/bench.py](src/movate/core/bench.py); CLI in [src/movate/cli/bench.py](src/movate/cli/bench.py); 8 unit tests. Cost (mean), latency (p50/p95), score (aggregated per gate-mode), errors, sample. Cross-family skipping with stderr note. Reads defaults from `movate.yaml: bench`.
- [x] **`MockProvider` is judge-aware** `[MED] [v0.2] [done]` — detects "Rubric:" in prompt, returns `{"score": 0.5, "rationale": "mock judge"}`; both responses overridable via env vars.

### Open

- [x] **Markdown reporter for CI annotation** `[MED→HIGH] [v0.2] [done]` — `render_eval_markdown` + `render_bench_markdown` in [src/movate/core/reporters.py](src/movate/core/reporters.py); `--output markdown` on both `mdk eval` and `mdk bench`. GFM-safe escaping (pipes, backticks), input truncation, `<details>` block for per-case rows, judge-skipped rows annotated. 8 tests in [tests/test_reporters.py](tests/test_reporters.py).
- [x] **`mdk pricing` (print table)** `[LOW→MED] [v0.2] [done]` — Rich table + `-o json` + `-p <prefix>` filter, in [src/movate/cli/pricing.py](src/movate/cli/pricing.py). 5 tests in [tests/test_pricing_cli.py](tests/test_pricing_cli.py).
- [ ] **Rubric library (3-5 standard rubrics)** `[MED] [v0.2] [≤1d]` — relevance, correctness, faithfulness, safety, tone. Imported by name from `evals/judge.yaml`.
- [ ] **`--parallel` flag for bench** `[MED] [v0.3] [≤1d]` — currently sequential; parallel respects per-provider rate limits.
- [ ] **Persist `BenchSummary` to sqlite** `[LOW] [v0.4] [≤1d]` — currently ephemeral; needed for trend tracking.
- [ ] **DeepEval integration** `[LOW] [v0.5+] [1w]` — defer until RAG-grounding metrics are actually needed.
- [ ] **Ragas integration** `[LOW] [v0.5+] [1w]` — same.
- [ ] **TruLens integration** `[LOW] [v0.7+] [1w]` — same.

## 3. Sequential workflows (Phase 3 / v0.3)

- [x] **`workflow.yaml` Pydantic spec** `[HIGH] [v0.3] [done]` — [src/movate/core/workflow/spec.py](src/movate/core/workflow/spec.py): `WorkflowSpec`, `NodeSpec`, `EdgeSpec`. `kind: Workflow`, `state_schema`, `entrypoint`, `nodes`, `edges`, semver+name validators.
- [x] **`WorkflowGraph` IR (internal)** `[HIGH] [v0.3] [done]` — [src/movate/core/workflow/ir.py](src/movate/core/workflow/ir.py): `WorkflowGraph`, `WorkflowNode`, `WorkflowEdge`, `NodeType` (AGENT, TOOL, HUMAN, FUNCTION, SUB_WORKFLOW), `EdgeKind` (SEQUENTIAL, CONDITIONAL, PARALLEL_FAN_OUT, PARALLEL_FAN_IN). Helpers: `successors`, `predecessors`, `sources`, `sinks`, `is_linear`, `topological_order`. Future-aware enums let v1.1's LangGraph compiler reuse the same IR without a schema break.
- [x] **Sequential compiler with strict validation** `[HIGH] [v0.3] [done]` — [src/movate/core/workflow/compiler.py](src/movate/core/workflow/compiler.py). Two-pass: `compile_workflow` (structural — duplicates, dangling edges, self-loops, cycles, orphans, state-schema validation) + `validate_linear` (v0.3 phase gate — rejects branches, joins, conditional edges, non-agent node types with phase-aware error messages). 27 tests in [tests/test_workflow.py](tests/test_workflow.py).
- [x] **Workflow runner — typed `WorkflowState` plumbing** `[HIGH] [v0.3] [done]` — [src/movate/core/workflow/runner.py](src/movate/core/workflow/runner.py). State projected onto each node's input schema; output shallow-merged back. State validated against `state_schema` at entry. 6 tests in [tests/test_workflow_runner.py](tests/test_workflow_runner.py).
- [x] **Per-node `RunRecord` linked by `workflow_run_id`** `[HIGH] [v0.3] [done]` — `RunRecord.workflow_run_id` + `node_id` fields; new `workflow_runs` sqlite table + `WorkflowRunRecord`; `list_runs(workflow_run_id=…)` filter; idempotent `ALTER` migrations.
- [x] **Partial-failure preservation** `[HIGH] [v0.3] [done]` — runner stops at the failing node, returns the pre-merge state, marks workflow `ERROR` with `error_node_id`. Per-node `RunRecord`s up to and including the failure are persisted.
- [x] **`mdk run <workflow>` extension** `[HIGH] [v0.3] [done]` — `is_workflow_path()` auto-detect in [src/movate/cli/_workflow_path.py](src/movate/cli/_workflow_path.py); `cli/run.py`, `cli/validate.py`, `cli/show.py` all dispatch.
- [x] **`mdk show workflow` topology render (ASCII / Mermaid)** `[MED] [v0.3] [done]` — Rich header + nodes table, ASCII chain (`first → second → third`), Mermaid `flowchart LR` block ready for PR descriptions. 9 tests in [tests/test_cli_workflow.py](tests/test_cli_workflow.py).
- [ ] **`--node-trace` flag** `[MED] [v0.3] [≤2h]` — surface intermediate states on stdout for debugging.
- [ ] **`workflow.yaml: runtime: <homegrown|langgraph>` field (parsed but warns on `langgraph`)** `[MED] [v0.3] [≤1h]` — future-proofs the YAML so v1.1 adds zero schema churn.
- [ ] **Throwaway IR→LangGraph prototype** `[HIGH] [v0.3] [1d]` — write it, prove the seam, **delete it** until v1.1. Mitigates the #1 risk in the plan.
- [ ] **Conditional edges** `[—] [v1.1] [—]` — explicitly OUT of v0.3.
- [ ] **Parallel fan-out** `[—] [v1.1] [—]` — out.
- [ ] **HITL nodes** `[—] [v1.1] [—]` — out.
- [ ] **Loops / iteration** `[—] [v1.1] [—]` — out.

## 4. Observability (Phase 4 / v0.4)

- [x] **Langfuse tracer** `[HIGH] [v0.4] [done]` — `LangfuseTracer` in [src/movate/tracing/langfuse.py](src/movate/tracing/langfuse.py); `build_tracer()` auto-selects via `MOVATE_TRACER=langfuse` or `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY` env. Falls back to stdout with a stderr warning if the package or keys are missing — never breaks a run. Client injectable so tests don't need the real SDK. `mdk doctor` now surfaces resolved tracer + LANGFUSE_* env vars. 12 tests in [tests/test_tracing_langfuse.py](tests/test_tracing_langfuse.py).
- [x] **OTel tracer (OTLP exporter)** `[HIGH] [v0.4] [done]` — `OtelTracer` in [src/movate/tracing/otel.py](src/movate/tracing/otel.py); OTLP-HTTP exporter via `BatchSpanProcessor`. `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` + optional `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` env vars. Tracer + provider injectable for tests; SDK imported lazily so the module loads without `opentelemetry`. Attribute coercion via `_otel_value` so dict / tuple / list values become OTel-acceptable JSON strings.
- [x] **Tracer auto-select via `MOVATE_TRACER`** `[MED] [v0.4] [done]` — `stdout | langfuse | otel | composite`. Auto-detects on env vars when unset.
- [x] **Composite tracer (multi-fanout)** `[MED] [v0.4] [done]` — `CompositeTracer` in [src/movate/tracing/composite.py](src/movate/tracing/composite.py). Per-span mapping back to per-delegate `SpanCtx`s so end/event/attribute fan-out. Each delegate wrapped in try/except — one bad backend can't kill siblings. 26 tests in [tests/test_tracing_otel.py](tests/test_tracing_otel.py) covering OtelTracer + CompositeTracer + all dispatch paths.
- [x] **`mdk trace replay <run-id>`** `[HIGH] [v0.4] [done]` — `core/replay.py` (engine) + `cli/trace.py` (rendering). Auto-detects agent vs workflow id, renders Rich tables + per-node breakdown for workflows, `--verbose` shows full input/output bodies, `--output json` is pipe-friendly. New `get_run(run_id)` + `get_workflow_run(id)` storage methods. 19 tests in [tests/test_replay.py](tests/test_replay.py) + [tests/test_cli_trace.py](tests/test_cli_trace.py).
- [ ] **`mdk logs <run-id> --tail`** `[MED] [v0.4] [≤1d]` — read sqlite + tracer events, render Rich timeline.
- [x] **Drift baseline (`mdk eval --baseline <eval-id>`)** `[HIGH] [v0.4] [done]` — `core/baseline.py` (`BaselineDiff` math, regression-detection) + `cli/eval.py` (`--baseline`, `--regression-tolerance`). Diffs mean_score, pass_rate, sample_count, cost; renders Rich diff table after eval output; includes `baseline` block in `-o json`; exits 1 on regression past tolerance. New `get_eval(eval_id)` storage method. 21 tests in [tests/test_baseline.py](tests/test_baseline.py). Per-case diff deferred to v0.4.1+ when datasets demand it.
- [ ] **Span attributes — token-level cost breakdown** `[MED] [v0.4] [≤2h]` — `cost_usd`, `pricing_version`, `cached_input_tokens` per provider call.
- [ ] **Privacy: redact prompt/output spans by config** `[MED] [v0.4] [≤1d]` — `tracer.redact_io: true` for tenants with PII.
- [ ] **Cost dashboards (Langfuse-side)** `[LOW] [v0.4] [—]` — delegated to Langfuse; just confirm dashboard exists.
- [ ] **Real-time event bus** `[LOW] [post-v1.0] [—]` — defer; tracing covers v0.4 needs.

---

## 5. Server + queue (Phase 5 / v0.5)

- [ ] **PostgresProvider (port + harden)** `[HIGH] [v0.5] [2-3d]` — asyncpg pool, `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, JSONB.
- [ ] **`migrations/0001_init.sql` runs on startup** `[HIGH] [v0.5] [≤1h]` — idempotent.
- [ ] **`movate.runtime.app` (FastAPI)** `[HIGH] [v0.5] [2-3d]` — `/run`, `/jobs/{id}`, `/agents`, `/healthz`.
- [ ] **`movate.runtime.worker`** `[HIGH] [v0.5] [2-3d]` — claim-next-job loop; concurrency-safe; metrics/healthz.
- [ ] **API key issuance + bcrypt hash (`mvt_<env>_<tenant>_<keyid>_<secret>`)** `[HIGH] [v0.5] [2-3d]` — multi-tenant safety from day one.
- [ ] **`mdk auth create-key|list-keys|revoke-key`** `[HIGH] [v0.5] [≤1d]` — operator UX.
- [x] **Tenant isolation audit (every query filtered by `tenant_id`)** `[HIGH] [v1.0] [done]` — every storage read / mutate path that touches per-tenant rows now filters by ``tenant_id`` in the SQL WHERE clause. 9 audit gaps closed (``get_run`` / ``get_workflow_run`` / ``get_eval`` / ``get_job`` / ``update_job`` / ``revoke_api_key`` / ``touch_api_key`` / ``list_evals`` / ``list_workflow_runs``). 30 cross-tenant fuzz test invocations in [tests/test_tenant_isolation.py](tests/test_tenant_isolation.py).
- [ ] **Idempotency on `/run` by `request_id`** `[HIGH] [v0.5] [≤1d]` — retry-safe; returns existing job.
- [ ] **`workflow_runs` table linking child runs** `[HIGH] [v0.5] [≤1d]` — needed once workflows are persistent.
- [ ] **`/run` rate limit (per tenant)** `[MED] [v0.5] [≤1d]` — prevents tenant from starving the queue.
- [ ] **Prom metrics endpoint** `[MED] [v0.5] [≤1d]` — `/metrics` for jobs, runs, latency, cost.
- [ ] **Redis** `[LOW] [post-v0.5] [—]` — defer; Postgres is enough through v1.0.
- [ ] **pgvector retrieval** `[—] [v1.2+] [—]` — deliberately out.

---

## 6. Deploy + CI gating (Phase 6 / v1.0)

- [x] **Bicep: ACA + Postgres Flex + Key Vault + ACR + Log Analytics** `[HIGH] [v1.0] [done]` — modular `infra/azure/modules/*.bicep` + `main.bicep` orchestrator; CI `bicep build` + `bicep lint`. Operator walkthrough at [infra/azure/README.md](infra/azure/README.md).
- [x] **`mdk deploy <env>`** `[HIGH] [v1.0] [done]` — wraps `az acr build` + `az containerapp update` (both apps) + `/healthz` poll. Image tag = `movate:<version>-<git-sha-short>`. Rollback via `--skip-build --image-tag <prev>`. 23 tests in [tests/test_deploy.py](tests/test_deploy.py).
- [ ] **GH Actions `validate.yml`** `[HIGH] [v1.0] [≤1d]` — schema + topology validation on every PR.
- [x] **GH Actions `eval-gate.example.yml` (block on regression)** `[HIGH] [v1.0] [done]` — `cli/eval.py` gained `--baseline-file <path>` and `--output-baseline <path>` flags so baselines can be git-tracked instead of stuck in ephemeral runner sqlite. Example workflow at [.github/workflows/eval-gate.example.yml](.github/workflows/eval-gate.example.yml) ships a `gate-pr` job (PR runs `--baseline-file`, exits 1 on regression past tolerance) and a `refresh-baseline` job (main-merge re-runs eval with `--output-baseline` and auto-commits). Docs at [docs/ci-eval-gate.md](docs/ci-eval-gate.md). 6 tests covering load, write, mutual exclusion, malformed-JSON path.
- [x] **GH Actions `deploy.yml` (release branch → ACA)** `[HIGH] [v1.0] [done]` — push to `release/<env>` (or `workflow_dispatch` with `target_env`) → Azure federated OIDC login → hydrate `~/.movate/config.yaml` from env-scoped GH secrets → `uv run movate deploy`. Per-env GitHub Environments gate prod with approval rules.
- [ ] **GH Actions `security.yml`** `[MED] [v1.0] [≤1d]` — dependency + secret scan.
- [x] **Model policy enforcement** `[HIGH] [v1.0] [done]` — `policy:` block on `movate.yaml` (allowed_providers, deny_models, max_cost_per_run_usd). Enforced at `mdk validate` (static) + `Executor.execute()` entry (runtime). 21 tests in [tests/test_policy.py](tests/test_policy.py).
- [ ] **Promotion semantics dev → staging → prod** `[MED] [v1.0] [≤1d]` — env profiles + revision tags.
- [ ] **Deployment health check + rollback** `[MED] [v1.0] [≤1d]` — `/healthz` poll + ACA revision pinning.
- [x] **Per-tenant cost ceiling enforcement** `[HIGH] [v1.0] [done]` — `TenantBudget` model + `tenant_budgets` table + `Executor._check_tenant_budget` at execute() entry. New `TenantBudgetExceededError` + CLI `mdk tenants set-budget | clear-budget | show | list`. Storage methods on all 3 backends. 24 tests in [tests/test_tenant_budget.py](tests/test_tenant_budget.py).
- [ ] **Multi-region** `[—] [post-v1.0] [—]` — out.
- [ ] **Blue/green** `[LOW] [post-v1.0] [—]` — ACA revisions cover most of this.

---

## 7. LangGraph swap-in + advanced (Phase 7 / v1.1+)

- [ ] **`workflow/compilers/langgraph.py`** `[HIGH] [v1.1] [1w]` — alternative compiler from `WorkflowGraph` IR; gated by `runtime: langgraph`.
- [ ] **Conditional edges** `[HIGH] [v1.1] [2-3d]` — `edges: [{from: A, to: B, when: "$.score > 0.7"}]`.
- [ ] **Parallel fan-out** `[HIGH] [v1.1] [2-3d]` — `fan_out` nodes with deterministic merge.
- [ ] **HITL nodes (`type: human`)** `[HIGH] [v1.1] [1w]` — pause workflow, await external resolve via `/runs/{id}/resume`.
- [ ] **Checkpointing (LangGraph-native)** `[HIGH] [v1.1] [2-3d]` — resume from last successful node after failure.
- [ ] **Tool registry (`movate.tools`)** `[HIGH] [v1.1] [1w]` — Python decorator → JSON schema → injected into prompt + tool-calling loop.
- [ ] **Built-in tools — `kb_search`, `http_get`, `sql_query`** `[MED] [v1.1] [3-5d]` — high reuse across customer engagements.
- [ ] **Skill packs (composable rule + prompt bundles)** `[MED] [v1.2] [1w]` — `grounding`, `citation_enforcement`, `pii_redaction`.
- [ ] **Provider routing rules (cost / latency / region)** `[HIGH] [v1.1] [3-5d]` — `models/routing.yaml`; declarative, enforced at executor.
- [ ] **Memory provider (PRD §F)** `[MED] [v1.2] [1w]` — short-term + long-term; sqlite + Postgres backends.
- [ ] **Retrieval provider (pgvector)** `[HIGH] [v1.2] [1w]` — embed + ANN; canonical "grounding" implementation.
- [ ] **RBAC** `[MED] [v1.2] [1w]` — role-keyed scopes on `mvt_*` keys.
- [ ] **Azure AD SSO** `[MED] [v1.3] [1w]`.
- [ ] **Visual workflow editor** `[—] [post-v2] [—]` — explicitly out per PRD §2.
- [ ] **Marketplace / registry UI** `[—] [post-v2] [—]` — out.
- [ ] **Autonomous self-modifying agents** `[—] [post-v2] [—]` — out.

## 8. Cross-cutting / developer experience (HIGH leverage globally)

These pay back across every phase. Don't queue them after v1.0 — interleave them.

- [ ] **Shell tab-completion (`mdk --install-completion`)** `[HIGH] [v0.1] [done]` — already wired by Typer.
- [ ] **`.env` auto-load** `[HIGH] [v0.1] [done]` — already wired.
- [x] **`movate.testing` fixtures package** `[HIGH] [v0.2] [done]` — public surface in [src/movate/testing/](src/movate/testing/): `InMemoryStorage`, `NullTracer`, `JudgeStubProvider`, `MockProvider`, `scaffold_agent`, `build_test_executor`. Pytest fixtures (`mock_provider`, `in_memory_storage`, `null_tracer`, `pricing`, `temp_agent_dir`, `build_executor`) auto-discovered via `pytest_plugins = ["movate.testing.fixtures"]`. 14 conformance tests in [tests/test_testing.py](tests/test_testing.py).
- [x] **`mdk watch <agent>` (hot-reload on YAML change)** `[MED] [v0.2] [done]` — polls agent.yaml + prompt + schemas + dataset + judge for mtime changes; re-runs `mdk validate` (with lint + cost forecast) on each change. Stdlib polling (zero new deps); 200ms debounce; resilient to broken-mid-save YAML. `--poll-interval` + `--strict` flags. 8 tests in [tests/test_watch.py](tests/test_watch.py).
- [x] **Templates beyond `agent_init` — `faq`, `summarizer`, `classifier`** `[HIGH] [v0.2] [done]` — registry at [src/movate/templates/__init__.py](src/movate/templates/__init__.py); `mdk init -t faq` (and `summarizer`, `classifier`). FAQ + summarizer ship with a `judge.yaml.example`; classifier uses exact-match. 21 tests in [tests/test_templates.py](tests/test_templates.py).
- [x] **Live-API smoke tests (env-gated)** `[HIGH] [v0.2] [done]` — [tests/test_smoke_litellm.py](tests/test_smoke_litellm.py) + [scripts/smoke.sh](scripts/smoke.sh). 3 tests covering OpenAI direct, Anthropic direct, and full executor against real OpenAI. Module-level `pytestmark = pytest.mark.smoke`; CI filters with `-m "not smoke"`. Each test independently gated on the relevant API key.
- [ ] **Workflow templates — `returns-processing`, `triage-then-respond`** `[MED] [v0.3] [≤1d]`.
- [ ] **VS Code launch configs (debug a single agent run)** `[MED] [v0.2] [≤2h]` — port from MDK if useful.
- [x] **`mdk run --replay <run-id>`** `[HIGH] [v0.4] [done]` — `core/run_replay.py` + `cli/run.py` flag. Re-executes a recorded `RunRecord` against the current agent bundle (prompt/model/schemas reload from disk). Surfaces `output_changed`, `status_changed`, `changed_keys`, cost + latency deltas. Output changes are not failures (debug tool); only a current-run error trips exit 1. Mutually exclusive with positional INPUT. Workflow replay deferred. 14 tests in [tests/test_run_replay.py](tests/test_run_replay.py).
- [ ] **`mdk diff <agent-a> <agent-b>`** `[MED] [v0.2] [≤1d]` — show prompt-hash, model, schema deltas; great for PR review.
- [x] **Prompt linter** `[MED] [v0.2] [done]` — `core/prompt_linter.py` with 4 rules (`UNDECLARED_INPUT_REF`, `EMPTY_PROMPT`, `MISSING_JSON_INSTRUCTION`, `NO_OUTPUT_SCHEMA_REFERENCE`, `TINY_PROMPT`). Wired into `mdk validate` with `--strict` (CI gate) and `--no-lint` flags. 19 tests in [tests/test_prompt_linter.py](tests/test_prompt_linter.py).
- [x] **Cost forecast on `validate`** `[MED] [v0.2] [done]` — `core/cost_forecast.py` with `estimate_eval_cost(bundle, *, pricing)`. Renders each case's prompt, estimates tokens via chars/4, multiplies by model's pricing. Prints a dim `eval cost:` line on every validate when dataset + pricing available; silent skip otherwise. 10 tests in [tests/test_cost_forecast.py](tests/test_cost_forecast.py).
- [ ] **`--dry-run` on `run`** `[MED] [v0.2] [≤2h]` — render prompt, show what *would* be sent, exit 0.
- [ ] **Structured logging (structlog) everywhere** `[MED] [v0.4] [≤1d]` — already a dep; standardize on it.
- [ ] **Docs site (mkdocs) — internal** `[LOW] [v0.6] [1w]` — defer; per-user decision is internal-only, README + `--help` is enough through v0.5.

---

## 9. MDK rebrand + canonical config (Deva's feedback, May 2026)

Strategic direction shift: position movate-cli as **MDK — Movate Development Kit**, an enterprise SDK with knowledge graphs, multi-tenancy, and adapter architecture. Some items below are already shipped (see notes); the new work is grouped in phases v0.6 → v1.0.

> **Resale-clean stack is the real constraint, not "make MDK sellable."**
> MDK itself isn't sold. But Movate-built customer solutions embed MDK's
> dependencies, so every dep's license must be permissive enough that the
> customer engagement can be resold without copyleft contamination, BSL
> service-competition clauses, or open-sourcing of proprietary work.
>
> Current stack is **100% permissively licensed** (MIT / Apache 2.0 / BSD) —
> see [docs/license-posture.md](docs/license-posture.md) (TBD).
> Future additions must clear the same bar.
>
> **Strategic answers from leadership (May 2026):**
> 1. **Multi-cloud (GCP/AWS): eventual.** Stay Azure-first; new infrastructure
>    decisions must be cloud-portable in principle. ADR captures the rule.
> 2. **Multi-tenant: both — SaaS AND self-hosted.** Most building blocks
>    already in place. Need Helm chart for K8s self-hosting; SaaS onboarding
>    flow. v1.0 work.
> 3. **Lyzr adapter: STRATEGIC + TIME-BOXED.** Most current customer agents
>    are on Lyzr. Build a read-only adapter + `mdk import lyzr <id>` →
>    `agent.yaml` migration tool. Bridge to migrate OFF Lyzr, not stay
>    integrated. Bump to v0.7-v0.8 priority (not v1.0). License-check first.
> 4. **Knowledge graph: aspirational, visualization-first.** Use Apache AGE
>    for storage (cheap, Postgres-native). The actual value is d3.js
>    interactive visualization of the graph + simple search/filter.
>    Becomes the demo "wow moment" in v0.9. Not a deep-query system.

### Tier 0 — Brand + naming (v0.6, ~1 week)

- [ ] **Rename `movate` CLI → `mdk`** `[HIGH] [v0.6] [2-3d]` — binary, package, env var prefix (`MOVATE_*` → `MDK_*`), config dir (`~/.movate/` → `~/.mdk/`). Mechanical but breaking. Keep `movate` as transitional alias for 2 releases.
- [ ] **Rename `movate.yaml` → `policy.yaml`** `[HIGH] [v0.6] [1d]` — loader checks both, prefers `policy.yaml`. Deprecation warning on old name.
- [ ] **Update demo repo + docs to use `mdk`** `[HIGH] [v0.6] [1d]` — README, ask.py subprocess calls, dev-loop.md, deck source files.

### Tier 1 — Canonical config files (v0.6, ~2-3 weeks)

- [ ] **`policy.yaml` (renamed from movate.yaml)** `[HIGH] [v0.6] [done-after-rename]` — already implements: allowed_providers, deny_models, max_cost_per_run_usd, tenant_budgets.
- [ ] **`runtime.yaml` — runtime + adapter selection + provider routing** `[HIGH] [v0.6] [3-5d]` — defaults for runtime kind (litellm|native_openai|native_anthropic|lyzr), per-agent overrides allowed; provider routing rules (cost/latency/region) merged here from §7.
- [ ] **`eval.yaml` — global eval defaults** `[HIGH] [v0.6] [2d]` — gate, gate_mode, regression_tolerance, runs_per_case, default judge model. Per-agent `evals:` block in agent.yaml overrides.
- [ ] **`knowledge.yaml` — KB sources + ingestion config** `[HIGH] [v0.6] [3d]` — vector DB pointer, KG endpoint, chunking strategy, embedding model. Per-agent `knowledge:` refs point at indices/namespaces declared here.
- [ ] **Layered context resolution: Global → Agent → Session** `[HIGH] [v0.6] [3d]` — formalize merge precedence; expose via `mdk config show` showing the resolved config for a given agent.

### Tier 2 — Agent definition expansion (v0.7, ~2 weeks)

- [ ] **Input/output examples in agent.yaml** `[HIGH] [v0.7] [2d]` — `examples: [{input: ..., output: ...}]`; `mdk validate` smoke-tests against these; powers downstream synthetic data generation.
- [ ] **Goals + objectives + KB refs as first-class agent.yaml fields** `[HIGH] [v0.7] [3d]` — structured `goals: [...]`, `objectives: [{id, threshold, judge}]`, `knowledge: [{kind, path|index|namespace}]`. Becomes the contract for test generation.
- [ ] **Modularize agent objectives for evaluation** `[HIGH] [v0.7] [3d]` — each objective is independently scored + reported (per-objective subscore in eval table). Eval gate can target individual objectives.

### Tier 3 — Multi-source onboarding + dynamic test gen (v0.7, ~3-4 weeks)

- [ ] **Onboard from Agent JSON** `[MED] [v0.7] [1d]` — `mdk onboard --from-json agent.json` builds equivalent of agent.yaml on disk.
- [ ] **Onboard from trace logs** `[MED] [v0.7] [1w]` — given recorded RunRecords, synthesize a starter agent.yaml (provider, schemas inferred from data shape).
- [ ] **Onboard from chat UI export** `[MED] [v0.7] [1w]` — common chat export formats (OpenAI, Anthropic, Claude.ai exports) → agent.yaml seed.
- [ ] **Black-box application testing (`mdk eval <http-url>`)** `[HIGH] [v0.7] [1w]` — hit an HTTP endpoint instead of a local agent; same eval framework, different runner.
- [ ] **Generate scenario test cases from agent goals** `[HIGH] [v0.7] [1w]` — LLM-generates cases across categories: positive / negative / edge / red-team. Output is a *suggested* dataset for human review — never auto-merged.
- [ ] **Synthetic test data generation** `[MED] [v0.7] [3-5d]` — opt-in via `mdk eval generate --synthetic`. Strong warning about over-reliance on synthetic data.
- [ ] **Expected-results generation (optional)** `[LOW] [v0.7] [3d]` — LLM-generates expected output for cases that lack one. Marked `auto_generated: true` so human reviewer can flip.
- [ ] **Test category tagging in dataset** `[MED] [v0.7] [1d]` — `tags: [positive | negative | edge | red_team | adversarial]`; eval table reports per-category pass rate.
- [ ] **Multi-run consistency analysis** `[MED] [v0.7] [2d]` — partially shipped (`--runs N`); add stddev + p10/p90 + confidence-interval bands to the eval report.

### Tier 4 — Knowledge architecture (v0.8 + v0.9, ~10-12 weeks total)

- [ ] **Evaluate open-source vector DB candidates** `[HIGH] [v0.8] [3d]` — `pgvector` (recommended; already have Postgres; PostgreSQL License — permissive), `Qdrant` (Apache 2.0), `Chroma` (Apache 2.0), `Weaviate` (BSD-3), `LanceDB` (Apache 2.0). All license-clean for customer resale. Write a 1-page decision doc.
- [ ] **Integrate pgvector (or chosen VDB)** `[HIGH] [v0.8] [1-2w]` — `MemoryProvider.vector_search()` + ingestion pipeline. `knowledge.yaml: vector_db:` config.
- [ ] **Evaluate open-source knowledge graph candidates** `[HIGH] [v0.9] [3d]` — `Apache AGE` (**recommended**; Postgres extension; Apache 2.0). **EXCLUDE**: Neo4j Community (GPLv3 — copyleft); Memgraph (BSL — service-competition restrictions). Acceptable alternatives: Kuzu (MIT), TerminusDB (Apache 2.0). Decision doc must explicitly state license + resale safety.
- [ ] **Integrate KG (Apache AGE)** `[HIGH] [v0.9] [1w]` — entity + relationship extraction at ingest; keep schema simple — this is a demo/visualization layer, not a deep-query system.
- [ ] **Canonical KB ingestion pipeline** `[HIGH] [v0.9] [2w]` — `mdk knowledge ingest <path>` runs: chunking → metadata → embedding → entity extraction → graph relationships. Configurable via `knowledge.yaml`.
- [ ] **Hybrid retrieval (vector + KG)** `[HIGH] [v0.9] [1w]` — query fans out to both; merge by score with configurable weights.
- [ ] **`mdk knowledge graph --serve` (d3.js visualization)** `[HIGH] [v0.9] [1-2w]` — HTTP endpoint returns `{nodes, edges}`; static HTML page renders a force-directed d3.js graph. Click a node → metadata + related KB chunks. **This is the demo wow-moment per Deva.** Showcases what the agent "knows" visually.
- [ ] **KG subgraph search + highlight** `[HIGH] [v0.9] [1w]` — search box on the d3.js page: "show me everything related to eval gates" → highlights the relevant subgraph + shows top-k KB chunks. Powered by hybrid retrieval (vector for KB chunks; graph traversal for entity neighborhoods).
- [ ] **Avoid cloud-native proprietary services** `[MED] [v0.9] [—]` — already done at model layer (LiteLLM). Infra layer (Azure) — scope a separate Terraform/Helm pass for GCP/AWS if/when business case is clear.

### Tier 5 — Memory architecture (v0.8, ~4 weeks parallel with VDB work)

- [ ] **Memory provider Protocol** `[HIGH] [v0.8] [3d]` — `MemoryProvider.read(layer, key)` + `write(...)` + `search(...)`; per-layer backends.
- [ ] **Session memory (per-run scratchpad, in-process)** `[HIGH] [v0.8] [2d]` — short-lived dict; cleared on run end.
- [ ] **Working memory (conversation context)** `[HIGH] [v0.8] [3d]` — Redis or Postgres with TTL; keyed by `conversation_id`.
- [ ] **Episodic memory (recent runs by tenant)** `[MED] [v0.8] [3d]` — already partially shipped (RunRecord); add retrieval helpers.
- [ ] **Semantic memory (KB-grounded long-term)** `[HIGH] [v0.8] [—]` — backed by vector DB (above).
- [ ] **Organizational memory (cross-tenant shared)** `[MED] [v0.9] [1w]` — separate VDB namespace + KG subgraph; opt-in per tenant.

### Tier 6 — Adapter architecture (v1.0, ~4 weeks)

- [ ] **Generic HTTP agent adapter** `[HIGH] [v1.0] [1w]` — POST to URL, expect JSON; black-box testing for any HTTP-served agent.
- [ ] **Lyzr adapter (read-only, migration bridge)** `[HIGH] [v0.7] [3-5d]` — invoke a Lyzr-hosted agent from MDK for eval/bench. License-check first (confirm Lyzr SDK is Apache 2.0 / MIT). Time-boxed: this is a bridge to migrate customer agents OFF Lyzr, not stay integrated.
- [ ] **`mdk import lyzr <agent-id>`** `[HIGH] [v0.8] [1w]` — pulls a Lyzr agent definition and synthesizes the equivalent MDK `agent.yaml`. Powers the migration story.
- [ ] **`docs/migrate-from-lyzr.md`** `[HIGH] [v0.8] [2d]` — walks customers through importing existing Lyzr agents into MDK-native. Critical because most current customer agents live on Lyzr.
- [ ] **Browser/Playwright adapter** `[LOW] [v1.0+] [2w]` — evaluate Web UIs. Gated on customer use case.
- [ ] **Trace replay adapter** `[—] [done]` — already shipped as `mdk run --replay` and `mdk trace replay`.

### Tier 7 — Comprehensive reporting + reconciliation (v1.0, ~3 weeks)

- [x] **Four-dimension eval reporting** `[HIGH] [v0.6] [done 2026-05-13]` — `accuracy` / `faithfulness` / `coverage` / `latency`, each scored per case, rolled up via `DimensionalMeans` on every `EvalSummary`. Dataset rows opt-in via `grounding`, `expected_coverage`, `latency_budget_ms` fields; legacy datasets see the v0.5 view byte-for-byte. CLI Rich table + `--output json` + markdown reporter all surface the rollup. Critical back-compat: gate stays on accuracy alone (`--gate 0.7` still means "70% accuracy"). 34 new tests; full suite 1166 → 1200. PR [#59](https://github.com/mova-io/mova-cli/pull/59).
- [ ] **Per-objective scoring breakdown** `[HIGH] [v1.0] [3d]` — eval table shows pass/fail per `objective.id` defined on agent.yaml.
- [ ] **Eval reconciliation across deterministic + LLM + HITL** `[HIGH] [v1.0] [1w]` — configurable precedence; "if all three disagree, fall back to HITL" pattern.
- [ ] **HITL workflow nodes (formalize)** `[HIGH] [v1.0] [1w]` — already in v1.1 plan; specify the request/resolve API.
- [ ] **Configurable fallback strategy chain (LLM → HITL → deterministic)** `[MED] [v1.0] [3d]` — per-eval-config; defaults to LLM-only.
- [ ] **Persist evaluation results to datastore** `[—] [done]` — already shipped (EvalRecord); just add per-dimension subscores when v1.0 lands.

### Tier 8 — Doctor + observability polish + license hygiene (v0.6+, ~1-2 weeks)

- [ ] **`mdk doctor --explain`** `[HIGH] [v0.6] [3d]` — for each check, render: what it does, why it matters, what failure means, the copy-pasteable fix.
- [ ] **Doctor output explainability doc** `[MED] [v0.6] [2d]` — `docs/doctor-explained.md` documents every line — what it tests, what's safe to ignore.
- [ ] **License column in `mdk doctor`** `[HIGH] [v0.6] [2d]` — every dep line shows SPDX license alongside install status. Operators see resale-safety at a glance. Pre-empts the "is this stack OK to embed in a customer solution?" question.
- [ ] **`mdk doctor --licenses` deep report** `[MED] [v0.6] [2d]` — full SPDX breakdown, per-dep license file links, separates required vs optional, flags any non-permissive entries in red.
- [ ] **`docs/license-posture.md`** `[HIGH] [v0.6] [2d]` — explains Movate's stance: every dep in MDK is permissively licensed (MIT / Apache 2.0 / BSD) so customer engagements can embed + resell MDK-based solutions without copyleft contamination. Documents the explicit avoid-list (GPL / AGPL / SSPL / BSL with restrictive clauses). Linkable from doctor and from customer-facing solution docs.
- [ ] **CI license check** `[HIGH] [v0.6] [3d]` — `pip-licenses` or equivalent runs on every PR; fails merge if a new dep introduces a copyleft / SSPL / BSL license. Allowlist of approved SPDX IDs in repo.
- [ ] **License-clean gate on new deps** `[HIGH] [ongoing]` — every new optional extra (vector DB, KG, adapter) goes through license review before merge. Mark approved deps in `pyproject.toml` comments with their SPDX ID.

### Tier 9 — Enterprise readiness (v1.0+, ongoing)

#### Teams integration — v0.7 milestone (CEO ask: sales-led demos)

The full design is in [ADR 003](docs/adr/003-teams-integration.md). Issues
[#65–#69 + #70 + #72](https://github.com/mova-io/mova-cli/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Ateams-integration)
track each slice; status here mirrors the v0.7 milestone.

- [x] **ADR 003 — Teams as a self-serve front door (design)** `[HIGH] [v0.7] [done 2026-05-13]` — design doc with three vertical slices (3.1 run-existing → 3.2 eval-with-upload → 3.3 saved-configs). Status: Proposed (open questions on multi-tenant prospects, Langfuse trace linking across tenants, mobile UX, streaming). PR [#60](https://github.com/mova-io/mova-cli/pull/60).
- [x] **Teams 3.1.a — Bot Framework webhook skeleton** `[HIGH] [v0.7] [done 2026-05-13]` — hand-rolled Activity protocol + `mdk teams-bot serve` Typer command + 28 tests. Hand-rolled instead of `botbuilder-core` to avoid ~30MB of transitive deps; SDK can land in the hardening PR. PR [#63](https://github.com/mova-io/mova-cli/pull/63).
- [x] **Teams 3.1.b — Adaptive Cards + MovateClient integration** `[HIGH] [v0.7] [done 2026-05-13]` — `@movate run faq-agent {...}` actually executes and renders a card with response/cost/latency/optional trace link. Five outcome variants → four card templates. PR [#82](https://github.com/mova-io/mova-cli/pull/82). Closes [#66](https://github.com/mova-io/mova-cli/issues/66).
- [x] **Teams 3.1.c — per-user identity binding** `[HIGH] [v0.7] [done 2026-05-13]` — `/movate connect`, `whoami`, `disconnect` DM-only; Fernet-encrypted `teams_users` sqlite table; LRU-cached per-user MovateClients; strict mode for multi-tenant. PR [#83](https://github.com/mova-io/mova-cli/pull/83). Closes [#67](https://github.com/mova-io/mova-cli/issues/67).
- [x] **Teams 3.1.d — file attachment handling** `[HIGH] [v0.7] [done 2026-05-13]` — drag agent.zip / dataset.jsonl into Teams; validate + ingest before run. PR [#86](https://github.com/mova-io/mova-cli/pull/86). Closes [#68](https://github.com/mova-io/mova-cli/issues/68).
- [x] **Teams 3.1.e — manifest + Azure Bot Service** `[HIGH] [v0.7] [done 2026-05-13]` — Teams app manifest (v1.16) + appPackage zipper + Bot Service Bicep + runbook. Azure-side action remains (run the steps in [docs/teams-deploy.md](docs/teams-deploy.md)) but unblocked from #65 because the same artifacts work against a personal Azure sub for testing. PR [#87](https://github.com/mova-io/mova-cli/pull/87). Closes [#69](https://github.com/mova-io/mova-cli/issues/69).
- [ ] **Teams hardening — JWT validation** `[MED] [v1.0] [1w]` — production auth before any public Teams exposure. Issue [#70](https://github.com/mova-io/mova-cli/issues/70).
- [ ] **Teams 3.2 — eval with bring-your-own data** `[HIGH] [v0.8] [1w]` — drag dataset + agent, scorecard updates per case via Bot Framework `UpdateActivity`. Surfaces the 4-dim rollup that shipped on 2026-05-13. Issue [#72](https://github.com/mova-io/mova-cli/issues/72).

#### Original Tier 9 line items

- [ ] **Reusable enterprise policy enforcement** `[HIGH] [v1.0] [1w]` — `mdk policy export/import` so teams can share `policy.yaml` snippets. Marketplace later.

- [ ] **Helm chart for self-hosted K8s deployment** `[HIGH] [v1.0] [1w]` — alternative to Bicep; gives customers a "self-host on your cluster" path. Works on EKS / GKE / AKS / on-prem K8s.
- [ ] **SaaS tenant onboarding flow** `[HIGH] [v1.0] [1w]` — `mdk tenants create` API + provisioning runbook for hosted-by-Movate customers.
- [ ] **`docs/adr/001-cloud-portability.md`** `[HIGH] [v0.6] [≤2h]` — captures the principle: stay Azure-first today, but every new infrastructure decision must be cloud-portable in principle. Lists what we won't add (Cosmos DB, Azure-only auth, etc). Cheap, prevents future lock-in regret.
- [ ] **GCP / AWS deployment runbooks** `[MED] [v1.1+] [1w each]` — Terraform modules for AWS (ECS + RDS) and GCP (Cloud Run + CloudSQL). Deferred until a real customer asks. Architecture's already portable; just need the IaC.
- [ ] **Enterprise governance compliance (SOC2 audit trail)** `[LOW] [v1.1+] [—]` — most building blocks shipped (audit log via failures table, RunRecord, OTel). Formal SOC2 scoping when first enterprise customer asks.
- [ ] **Asymmetric signing for runtime auth (RS256 / KV-HSM)** `[LOW] [v1.1+] [~1-2w]` — today's auth is opaque token + per-key `secret_hash + salt` in storage (NOT JWT — there's no shared signing secret to rotate). Works fine for single-tenant deployments. When we add agent-to-agent service auth or hosted multi-tenant SaaS, move to RS256 signed by Azure Key Vault HSM with deliberate Key Vault rotation operations, plus a short-lived-access + long-lived-refresh token split. Deferred until the use case actually shows up.

## 10. RAG enhancements (May 2026)

Operator ask 2026-05-19: improve MDK's RAG story so agents can retrieve their
own context (not require the caller to pre-fetch chunks). Each item below
is a micro-sprint sized to ≤5 hours so it fits in one focused work block.

**Critical context.** Today's `rag-qa` template requires the caller to pass
`context: list[str]` as input — there's no internal retrieval, no KB
ingestion pipeline, no vector store. The `skill_kb_lookup` template does
static JSON-file lookup but doesn't embed or do semantic search.

**Phasing principle.** Each tier compounds the previous one's value; pick
tiers serially. Within a tier, items can run in parallel.

---

### Tier 10.1 — Vector retrieval (~3 weeks ÷ 8 micro-sprints)

Foundation: pgvector + embeddings + chunking + ingest CLI + a working
skill. Without this tier, every other RAG enhancement is blocked.

- [ ] **pgvector extension + `kb_chunks` Postgres migration** `[HIGH] [v0.9] [≤2h]` — `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;` + new table with `embedding vector(1536)` column + ivfflat index + tenant_id + agent + chunk_text + source_uri + ord + content_hash. Idempotent migration in `storage/postgres.py`. No new code paths yet — schema only.
- [ ] **Sqlite fallback: in-memory cosine similarity** `[HIGH] [v0.9] [2-3h]` — sqlite has no native vector type. Store embeddings as JSON-encoded float arrays; do cosine similarity in Python at query time. Acceptable for dev / CI / small KBs (<10k chunks). Same storage protocol surface as Postgres so callers don't care which backend they're on.
- [ ] **Embedding-provider abstraction (`EmbeddingProvider` Protocol)** `[HIGH] [v0.9] [≤2h]` — `embed(texts: list[str]) -> list[list[float]]` + `name` + `dimension` properties. Pure interface in `core/embeddings.py`. No impl yet.
- [ ] **OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` impl** `[HIGH] [v0.9] [2-3h]` — concrete `EmbeddingProvider` using OpenAI's embeddings endpoint via httpx (NOT litellm — we want a dedicated path with cost accounting). 1536-dim. Tests via stub.
- [ ] **Anthropic Voyage embeddings impl** `[MED] [v0.9] [2-3h]` — second concrete `EmbeddingProvider` (`voyage-2`, 1024-dim) so cross-family enforcement works in eval. Same interface; auto-select based on agent's primary provider.
- [ ] **Recursive markdown chunker** `[HIGH] [v0.9] [3-4h]` — `chunk_text(text, max_tokens=500, overlap=50)` honoring markdown heading boundaries. Returns `list[Chunk]` with `text`, `metadata` (heading path, section index). Tokenization via tiktoken. Tests on a representative agents/rag-qa/contexts/*.md fixture.
- [ ] **`mdk kb ingest <dir>` CLI command** `[HIGH] [v0.9] [3-4h]` — walks `<dir>`, reads .md / .txt files, chunks, embeds, writes to `kb_chunks` table for the configured agent. Idempotent (content_hash dedup). Surfaces a progress bar + final summary. Tests with --mock embedding.
- [ ] **`kb-vector-lookup` skill template** `[HIGH] [v0.9] [3-4h]` — new skill template under `src/movate/templates/skill_kb_vector_lookup/`; agent calls it at run time with the user's question; skill embeds the question, retrieves top-K chunks, returns them as context for the prompt. End-to-end test with the rag-qa agent.

### Tier 10.2 — Quality (~1.5 weeks ÷ 5 micro-sprints)

Once vector retrieval lands, the next 25% of recall + precision lives here.
Hybrid search alone is typically a 15-25% recall jump on real corpora.

- [ ] **Postgres full-text index for `kb_chunks.chunk_text`** `[HIGH] [v0.9] [≤2h]` — `CREATE INDEX ... USING gin(to_tsvector('english', chunk_text))`. Updates the schema migration. No new query paths yet.
- [ ] **BM25-style FTS query method on storage** `[HIGH] [v0.9] [2-3h]` — `kb_search_lexical(query, agent, limit) -> list[Chunk]` using Postgres `tsquery` + `ts_rank`. Sqlite path uses FTS5 (already available). Tests with a known corpus.
- [ ] **Reciprocal rank fusion (RRF) combiner** `[HIGH] [v0.9] [≤2h]` — pure function `fuse(vector_results, lexical_results, k=60) -> list[Chunk]`. RRF score = sum(1 / (k + rank)) per chunk across both lists. Tests with synthetic input.
- [ ] **Wire RRF into `kb-vector-lookup` skill behind `--hybrid` flag** `[HIGH] [v0.9] [2-3h]` — when enabled, run both vector + lexical paths in parallel (asyncio.gather), fuse, return top-K. Default off in v0.9 → on in v0.10 after benchmarking.
- [ ] **Cross-encoder rerank (BAAI/bge-reranker-base)** `[MED] [v0.9] [3-4h]` — fetch 20 via hybrid, rerank to 5 with a small cross-encoder model. `--rerank` flag. Adds ~200ms latency but dramatically better precision at top-K. Lazy-loaded model (sentence-transformers extra).

### Tier 10.3 — Smarter retrieval (~1 week ÷ 4 micro-sprints)

Query rewriting + multi-hop. The query rewriter alone is the cheapest
quality win after Tier 10.1; multi-hop is the big capability unlock for
complex questions.

- [ ] **Query rewriter LLM call** `[MED] [v0.9] [≤2h]` — `rewrite_query(question, n=3) -> list[str]` via a small LLM call (gpt-4o-mini or claude-haiku). Prompt: "Rewrite this question as N alternative phrasings for retrieval." Returns N variants + original.
- [ ] **Fan-out + dedup in `kb-vector-lookup`** `[MED] [v0.9] [2-3h]` — when query rewriting enabled, fetch top-K for each variant, dedup by `chunk.id`, then rerank. `--rewrite-queries N` flag.
- [ ] **Multi-hop retrieval loop scaffolding** `[MED] [v0.9] [3-4h]` — `multi_hop(question, max_hops=3, max_total_chunks=15) -> list[Chunk]` that alternates retrieve → reason ("do we have enough to answer?") → retrieve. Budget-bounded so a bad question can't loop forever. New skill template `kb-multi-hop`.
- [ ] **Per-hop termination prompt + tests** `[MED] [v0.9] [3-4h]` — the LLM call that decides "stop fetching, we have enough" or "fetch with this refined question". Tests with mocked LLM scoring on a 3-hop synthetic benchmark.

### Tier 10.4 — Quality measurement (~3 days ÷ 2 micro-sprints)

The scorecard's existing `faithfulness` measures "answer matches context"
but not "citations point to chunks that actually support the answer."

- [ ] **`citation_accuracy` scorecard category — judge prompt** `[MED] [v0.9] [≤2h]` — new prompt in `eval_scorecard_cmd.py`'s judge rubric: "For each citation in the answer, verify the cited chunk actually contains the fact being cited. Score 0-1." Updates the 10-category constant to 11.
- [ ] **Wire `citation_accuracy` into scorecard aggregation + tests** `[MED] [v0.9] [3-4h]` — adds the new category to `ALL_CATEGORIES`, plumbs through `_score_one_case`, updates the JSON output shape, adds 3-4 tests covering "all citations correct → 1.0", "wrong-chunk citation → 0.5", "no citations → 0.0".

### Tier 10.5 — Conversation memory (~5 days ÷ 3 micro-sprints)

Multi-turn RAG (chat-style) — operator asks a follow-up that references
the previous turn ("and what about the prorated case?"). Today every run
is independent.

- [ ] **`conversation_threads` Postgres table** `[MED] [v1.0] [≤2h]` — `(thread_id PK, tenant_id, agent, created_at)`. Runs join via `RunRecord.thread_id` (new optional column).
- [ ] **`POST /threads/{id}/messages` endpoint** `[MED] [v1.0] [3-4h]` — submit a message in the context of a thread; the runtime fetches last N runs from the thread, formats as conversation history, prepends to the agent's prompt.
- [ ] **Chainlit playground: thread-aware mode** `[MED] [v1.0] [3-4h]` — playground stores `thread_id` per Chainlit session; subsequent messages go via `/threads/{id}/messages` instead of `/run`. UI shows the conversation history.

### Tier 10.6 — Document parsers (~2 weeks ÷ 5 micro-sprints)

Most real KB content isn't markdown — it's PDF policies, DOCX runbooks,
HTML scraped from internal wikis. Without these parsers, `mdk kb ingest`
is limited to whatever's already in plain text.

- [ ] **`DocumentParser` Protocol** `[LOW] [v1.0] [≤2h]` — interface in `core/parsers.py`: `parse(path) -> ParsedDocument(title, text, sections)`. Per-format impls register via entry point.
- [ ] **PDF parser (pypdf)** `[LOW] [v1.0] [3-4h]` — handles text-based PDFs (NOT scanned image PDFs — that needs OCR, separate item). Extracts page-by-page, heuristic section detection from font-size jumps.
- [ ] **DOCX parser (python-docx)** `[LOW] [v1.0] [3-4h]` — straightforward; docx is XML under the hood. Honors heading levels for section structure.
- [ ] **HTML parser (readability-lxml)** `[LOW] [v1.0] [3-4h]` — readability extracts the "main article content" from messy HTML (think: Confluence pages, blog posts). Strips nav / ads / sidebars before chunking.
- [ ] **Wire parsers into `mdk kb ingest`** `[LOW] [v1.0] [≤2h]` — dispatch on file extension. Surfaces parse errors per-file without aborting the batch.

---

**Sizing note:** Tier 10.1's 8 sprints land in ~3 weeks of focused 1-sprint-per-day cadence. Faster if multiple devs parallelize (each sprint is mostly independent — only the kb-vector-lookup skill template depends on the rest).

**Out of scope (deferred to follow-ups):**

- **OCR for scanned PDFs** — needs tesseract or a hosted OCR service. Real but niche.
- **Live re-indexing on KB changes** — today's `mdk kb ingest` is batch-only. A file-watcher mode could refresh chunks as files change.
- **Multi-vector representations (dense + sparse + late-interaction)** — research-quality improvements over RRF; deferred until we have benchmark numbers showing RRF is the bottleneck.
- **Customer-supplied embedding endpoints (BYOE)** — operators with their own fine-tuned embedding models. Niche; deferred.
- **GraphRAG** (knowledge-graph-backed retrieval) — substantial scope, separate ADR before committing.

## How to use this file

1. Pick the highest item from §0 ("Top 10") that isn't blocked.
2. Move it to `[ip]` while you work.
3. On merge, flip to `[x]` with the actual completion date in a commit message — the file itself stays clean.
4. Re-rank the Top 10 every two weeks. Leverage shifts as context changes.

## How to keep this file current

> The pattern: **each PR-shipping session ends with two doc updates** —
> a daily progress log (`docs/progress/<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`) AND the
> top-of-list paragraph here. The daily log is the linear narrative;
> this file is the persistent ranked backlog.

When a PR merges (or a coherent session of merges lands), at end of session:

1. **Drop a top-of-list paragraph** in `🎯 Top 10 highest-leverage shortlist` →
   `### Session <YYYY-MM-DD>` — most-recent first. Each paragraph follows
   the existing pattern: `**<Feature> shipped this session.**` + numeric test
   delta + 2-3 sentences of what / why / where + PR link + linked issue.
   Keep the bold opener + the closing **bold conclusion** sentence — readers
   skim those.
2. **Flip checkboxes** down in §1–§9 for any pre-existing line items the
   session completed. Replace `[ ]` with `[x]`, change `[next]` /
   `[ip]` to `[done <YYYY-MM-DD>]`, and append a one-line outcome summary
   with a PR link. Don't delete the original description — operators
   read this for context on WHY something was on the list.
3. **Add new line items** for follow-up work the session uncovered. New
   items default to `[ ]` and get linked to their GitHub issue.
4. **Re-rank the Top 10** if today's work shifted what's most leverage-
   per-effort. Items move between groups (A / B / C / D) freely.

Mechanically: this file changes on every PR-shipping day. The
[daily progress log](docs/progress/) is the source of truth for
"what was shipped"; this file is the source of truth for "what's next
+ relative priority." Don't let them drift.
