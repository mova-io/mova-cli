# Implementation tracker — ADR 012–016 build-out

Living tracker for implementing the accepted/proposed architecture ADRs
(012–016) plus a few high-leverage standalone features. Ordered by build
sequence (dependencies + leverage). **Versioning is CalVer `YYYY.M.D.N`,
auto-bumped per merged PR** — the "Merged" column is `mdk --version` at merge.

**LOE is Claude wall-clock** (background build-agent + verify/bump/PR + CI/merge),
**not human dev-days** — grounded in this session's observed ~9–16 min agent
builds. Buckets: **S ≈ ≤25 min · M ≈ 25–45 min · L ≈ 1–2 hr (often 2 PRs).**
🔒 = code lands fast in Claude time, but *final validation* is gated on a live
**Azure subscription / IdP** (external — not Claude time).

| # | Item | ADR / ref | LOE (Claude) | Depends on | Status | PR | Merged |
|---|------|-----------|--------------|------------|--------|----|--------|

## Robustness & hardening (items 22+) — production-readiness gaps

From the platform-robustness review: the *functional* surface is feature-complete,
but these close the gap from "feature-complete" to "production-robust." Three
classes — **(A) deferred safety behaviors** explicitly punted during the feature
build, **(B) operational hardening**, **(C) operator docs**. Several are 🔒 (code
lands in Claude time; final validation needs a live Azure subscription). The
single biggest caveat is not a row below: **none of the 🔒 infra code (items 11,
15, 19–21) has been exercised on a real Azure subscription — a staging deploy +
smoke pass is the gate to calling the platform production-ready.**

| # | Item | Class | ADR / ref | LOE (Claude) | Depends on | Status | PR | Merged |
|---|------|-------|-----------|--------------|------------|--------|----|--------|
| 22 | **Auto-rollback on drift** — when a scheduled eval flags a challenger regression, opt-in auto-revert to champion (weight→0 + restore champion); informs by default, auto only when enabled | A | 016.D5 | M (~30m) | #10, #12 | ✅ | #396 | `2026.5.24.6` |
| 23 | **Trigger replay / idempotency** — delivery-id / nonce store so a duplicate inbound event doesn't double-enqueue a run | A | 017.D2 | M (~30m) | #13 | ✅ | #398 | `2026.5.24.8` |
| 24 | **Per-dimension drift** — persist per-dimension eval means on `EvalRecord`; extend `drift.py` to compare per-dimension, not just aggregate mean/pass-rate | A | 016.D2 | M (~30m) | #10 | ✅ | #397 | `2026.5.24.7` |
| 25 | **Per-tenant rate-limiting / quota** at the runtime edge — token-bucket / sliding-window per (tenant, scope), 429 on exceed; portable app-level (always-on, complements #21) | B | 013 / feature | M (~35m) | scopes | ✅ | #400 | `2026.5.24.10` |
| 26 | **DR / backup runbook + tooling** for Postgres storage — documented backup/restore + point-in-time, plus a `mdk` export/import escape hatch | B | feature | M (~35m) 🔒 | — | ⬜ | | `____` |
| 27 | **Golden-signal SLOs + alerting** — readiness/liveness probes + latency / error-rate / queue-depth metrics → Azure Monitor alert rules (beyond drift) | B | 015 | M–L (~45m) 🔒 | #4 | ⬜ | | `____` |
| 28 | **Load / soak test harness** — drive the job-queue + KEDA autoscale path under load; capture baseline throughput/latency; documented results | B | feature | M (~35m) 🔒 | #11 | ⬜ | | `____` |
| 29 | **Operator runbooks** — configure/operate/troubleshoot the new surfaces (scheduler, triggers, durable/HITL, canary, harvest, continuous-eval, batch, SSE) | C | docs | M (~30m) | (features land) | ⬜ | | `____` |
| 30 | **Per-tenant BYOK provider keys** — each tenant stores its own OpenAI/Anthropic key (Fernet-encrypted at rest); `ProviderKeyResolver` (tenant→shared fallback); `mdk keys set\|list\|delete\|test` + `/api/v1/provider-keys`; admin-gated, value never returned | D | **018** | M–L (~45m) | scopes | ⬜ | | `____` |
| 31 | **Stale-job reaper / visibility timeout** — requeue jobs orphaned in `running` when a worker hard-crashes (OOM/SIGKILL/node loss); dead-letter once the retry budget is exhausted. Reaper runs in the worker loop (primary) + scheduler tick (scaled-to-zero backstop). No schema change (reuses `claimed_at`/`attempt_count`). | A | 017 / feature | M (~30m) | scheduler, worker | ⬜ | | `____` |
| 32 | **Distributed trace propagation across the queue** — inject W3C `traceparent` into `JobRecord` at enqueue, extract + continue in the worker so submit→queue→execute is ONE trace in App Insights (additive `trace_context` column; ADR 019) | B | 015 / 019 | M–L (~45m) | #62 | ⬜ | | `____` |
| 33 | **OTel metrics instruments** — `Meter` + counters/histograms (queue depth, job latency, dead-letter rate, in-flight, per-tenant tokens/cost) feeding the item-27 alert rules | B | 015 | M (~35m) | #62 | ⬜ | | `____` |
| 34 | **Per-job execution timeout + run cancellation** — bound a hung provider call (→ retry/dead-letter); cancel a queued/in-flight async run | A | 017 / feature | M (~30m) | #31 | ⬜ | | `____` |
| 35 | **Control-plane audit telemetry** — structured audit events for key mint/revoke/rotate, canary promote, drift auto-rollback (the "who did what, when" trail) | B | 013 / 016 | M (~30m) | — | ⬜ | | `____` |

## How this is maintained
As each PR merges, its row flips to ✅ and the **Merged** column is stamped with
the CalVer version at merge. New items append to the relevant section. The
authoritative feature backlog stays in [`BACKLOG.md`](BACKLOG.md); this file is
the focused build queue for the 012–016 arc.

> **A note on "Claude time":** the dominant wall-clock cost per item is the
> background build-agent run (~9–16 min observed) + a CI cycle (~5–12 min) + my
> verify/bump/PR, plus the occasional rebase when two PRs share the version
> line. The estimates assume that pipeline. They are **not** an estimate of
> human engineering effort, which for these items would be the days-scale
> figures in `BACKLOG.md`.
