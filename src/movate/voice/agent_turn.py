"""The ``AgentTurn`` seam — the pipeline's agent stage, framework-neutral.

ADR 067 (D2). The voice pipeline (:func:`movate.voice.pipeline.run_voice_pipeline`)
is *audio → STT → **an agent** → TTS → audio*. The middle stage used to be the
mdk ``Executor``, hard-coded — which is what tied the whole package to mdk. This
module is the seam that removes that tie: the pipeline depends on the tiny
``AgentTurn`` Protocol, and *anything* that turns text into text satisfies it —
the mdk ``Executor`` (via an ``ExecutorAgentTurn`` adapter that lives in mdk), a
Lyzr ADK agent (:mod:`movate.voice.lyzr`, ADR 069), a LangGraph graph, or a bare
async function.

It is the same seam shape as the speech Protocols in :mod:`movate.voice.base`:

* a streaming-friendly callback (``on_token``) so the agent's output streams as
  it is produced — what makes the "agent starts speaking before the full answer
  exists" latency story possible (the pipeline forwards each token as an
  ``agent.token`` event);
* **no audio, no codecs, no mdk types** in the contract — an ``AgentTurn`` only
  ever sees the final transcript text and returns text. An audio concern
  reaching this seam would be a boundary violation (the agent never learns the
  text arrived as speech).

The result envelope (:class:`AgentTurnResult`) carries exactly what the
pipeline's terminal ``done`` / ``error`` events need — the final answer text, a
run id and status for the transport, and a typed error for the graceful-degrade
path (ADR 048 D8) — and nothing more.

      empty when the agent's tracing is off (the default for a bare adapter).

    (ADR 069), or any text-in/text-out callable. The implementation owns *how*
    the transcript maps to its agent (mdk binds it to an ``agent.yaml`` input
    field; Lyzr passes it straight to ``agent.run``) — that binding is
    deliberately **not** the pipeline's concern.

    A new agent backend is a **new class implementing this Protocol** — the same
    extension story as adding a speech adapter (:mod:`movate.voice.base`).

    ``speculatable`` (ADR 070 D3, optional, default-read as ``False``) declares
    that a ``run`` started *speculatively* on a stable interim transcript is safe
    to **cancel and discard** before completion — i.e. it performs no
    irreversible side effect (committed memory write, non-idempotent tool call)
    before the first token, and treats cancellation as "this turn did not
    happen." The pipeline only speculates (``speculative=True``) on an agent that
    sets this to ``True``; an agent with eager side effects leaves it ``False``
    and is never speculated on. Read defensively via ``getattr(agent,
    "speculatable", False)`` so existing implementations that predate this field
    are correctly treated as non-speculatable.
