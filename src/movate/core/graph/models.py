"""Graphology-native view models for the read-only graph query API (ADR 046).

These models are the **wire contract** the sigma.js client imports with
zero transform. ``GraphologyDoc`` serializes to exactly the shape
``graphology.Graph.import()`` accepts::

    { "attributes": {},
      "nodes": [ {"key": "<id>", "attributes": {...}} ],
      "edges": [ {"key": "<id>", "source": "<id>", "target": "<id>",
                  "attributes": {...}} ] }

Deliberately separate from :mod:`movate.core.models` (the *persisted*
Entity/Relation schema) so the visualization contract evolves
independently of storage — same separation rationale as
``runtime/schemas.py`` vs ``core/models.py``. ``runtime/schemas.py``
re-exports thin ``*View`` wrappers around these for the HTTP layer; the
field shapes are identical so a view is a structural pass-through.
